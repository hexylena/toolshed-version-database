The pipeline maps data to a specified reference genome and removes artefacts that would otherwise hinder subsequent analysis. HiCUP also produces an easy-to-interpret yet detailed quality control (QC) report that assists in refining experimental protocols for future studies. The software is freely available and has already been used for processing Hi-C and CHi-C data in several recently published peer-reviewed studies.","date":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","citationCount":169,"authors":[{"name":"Wingett S."},{"name":"Ewels P."},{"name":"Furlan-Magaril M."},{"name":"Nagano T."},{"name":"Schoenfelder S."},{"name":"Fraser P."},{"name":"Andrews S."}],"journal":"F1000Research"}}],"credit":[{"name":"Steven Wingett","email":"steven.wingett@babraham.ac.uk","url":null,"orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Primary contact"],"note":null}],"community":null,"owner":"seqwiki_import","additionDate":"2017-01-13T13:15:01Z","lastUpdate":"2021-04-16T05:57:56Z","editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"validated":1,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":null}
