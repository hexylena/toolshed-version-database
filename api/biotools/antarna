Although for the latter the functional fold of an RNA molecule is to be found, inverse folding tries to identify RNA sequences that fold into a function-specific target structure. In combination with RNA-based biotechnology and synthetic biology, reliable RNA sequence design becomes a crucial step to generate novel biochemical components. Results: In this article, the computational tool antaRNA is presented. It is capable of compiling RNA sequences for a given structure that comply in addition with an adjustable full range objective GC-content distribution, specific sequence constraints and additional fuzzy structure constraints. antaRNA applies ant colony optimization meta-heuristics and its superior performance is shown on a biological datasets.","date":"2015-10-01T00:00:00Z","citationCount":22,"authors":[{"name":"Kleinkauf R."},{"name":"Mann M."},{"name":"Backofen R."}],"journal":"Bioinformatics"}}],"credit":[{"name":"University Freiburg","email":null,"url":null,"orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Institute","typeRole":["Provider"],"note":null},{"name":"rnateam","email":null,"url":null,"orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Institute","typeRole":["Provider"],"note":null},{"name":"Rolf Backofen","email":"rna@rna.informatik.uni-freiburg.de","url":null,"orcidid":"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8231-3323","gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Developer"],"note":null},{"name":"Robert Kleinkauf","email":"robertk@informatik.uni-freiburg.de","url":null,"orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Developer"],"note":null},{"name":"Rolf Backofen","email":"rna@rna.informatik.uni-freiburg.de","url":null,"orcidid":"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8231-3323","gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Primary contact"],"note":null},{"name":"Robert Kleinkauf","email":"robertk@informatik.uni-freiburg.de","url":null,"orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Primary contact"],"note":null}],"community":null,"owner":"rnateam","additionDate":"2016-01-20T14:19:03Z","lastUpdate":"2019-01-11T00:55:43Z","editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"validated":1,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":null}
