{"name":"Clair3","description":"Clair3 is a germline small variant caller for long-reads. Clair3 makes the best of two major method categories: pileup calling handles most variant candidates with speed, and full-alignment tackles complicated candidates to maximize precision and recall. Clair3 runs fast and has superior performance, especially at lower coverage. Clair3 is simple and modular for easy deployment and integration.","homepage":"https://github.com/HKU-BAL/Clair3","biotoolsID":"clair3","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:clair3","version":["0.1-r12"],"otherID":[],"relation":[],"function":[{"operation":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3227","term":"Variant calling"}],"input":[],"output":[],"note":null,"cmd":null}],"toolType":[],"topic":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3321","term":"Molecular genetics"}],"operatingSystem":[],"language":[],"license":null,"collectionID":[],"maturity":null,"cost":null,"accessibility":null,"elixirPlatform":[],"elixirNode":[],"elixirCommunity":[],"link":[],"download":[],"documentation":[],"publication":[],"credit":[],"community":null,"owner":"gallardoalba","additionDate":"2022-10-26T10:15:39.347589Z","lastUpdate":"2022-10-26T10:15:39.350099Z","editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"validated":0,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":null}
