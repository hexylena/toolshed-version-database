Their broader roles in bacterial adaptation remain mysterious, partly due to lack of computational tools. We made a program-IntegronFinder-to identify integrons with high accuracy and sensitivity. IntegronFinder is available as a standalone program and as a web application. It searches for attC sites using covariance models, for integron-integrases using HMM profiles, and for other features (promoters, attI site) using pattern matching. We searched for integrons, integron-integrases lacking attC sites, and clusters of attC sites lacking a neighboring integron-integrase in bacterial genomes. All these elements are especially frequent in genomes of intermediate size. They are missing in some key phyla, such as α-Proteobacteria, which might reflect selection against cell lineages that acquire integrons. The similarity between attC sites is proportional to the number of cassettes in the integron, and is particularly low in clusters of attC sites lacking integron-integrases. The latter are unexpectedly abundant in genomes lacking integron-integrases or their remains, and have a large novel pool of cassettes lacking homologs in the databases. They might represent an evolutionary step between the acquisition of genes within integrons and their stabilization in the new genome.","date":"2016-06-02T00:00:00Z","citationCount":193,"authors":[{"name":"Cury J."},{"name":"Jove T."},{"name":"Touchon M."},{"name":"Neron B."},{"name":"Rocha E.P."}],"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research"}},{"doi":"10.3390/microorganisms10020224","pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"type":["Primary"],"version":"2.0.1","note":null,"metadata":{"title":"Integron Functionality and Genome Innovation: An Update on the Subtle and Smart Strategy of Integrase and Gene Cassette Expression Regulation","abstract":"Integrons are considered hot spots for bacterial evolution, since these platforms allow one-step genomic innovation by capturing and expressing genes that provide advantageous novelties, such as antibiotic resistance. The acquisition and shuffling of gene cassettes featured by integrons enable the population to rapidly respond to changing selective pressures. However, in order to avoid deleterious effects and fitness burden, the integron activity must be tightly controlled, which happens in an elegant and elaborate fashion, as discussed in detail in the present review. Here, we aimed to provide an up‐to‐date overview of the complex regulatory networks that permeate the expression and functionality of integrons at both transcriptional and translational levels. It was possible to compile strong shreds of evidence clearly proving that these versatile platforms include functions other than acquiring and expressing gene cassettes. The well‐balanced mechanism of integron expression is intricately related with environmental signals, host cell physiology, fitness, and survival, ultimately leading to adaptation on the demand.","date":"2022-02-01T00:00:00Z","citationCount":9,"authors":[{"name":"Fonseca E.L."},{"name":"Vicente A.C."}],"journal":"Microorganisms"}}],"credit":[{"name":"Institut Pasteur","email":null,"url":"http://www.pasteur.fr/en","orcidid":null,"gridid":"grid.428999.7","rorid":"0495fxg12","fundrefid":"10.13039/501100003762","typeEntity":"Institute","typeRole":["Provider"],"note":null},{"name":"C3BI","email":null,"url":"https://research.pasteur.fr/en/center/c3bi/","orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Division","typeRole":[],"note":null},{"name":"ERC EVOMOBILOME","email":null,"url":"https://erc.europa.eu/projects-and-results/erc-funded-projects/evomobilome","orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Funding agency","typeRole":["Contributor"],"note":null},{"name":"Jean Cury","email":"jean.cury@normalesup.org","url":null,"orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Support"],"note":null},{"name":"Bertrand Neron","email":"bneron@pasteur.fr","url":null,"orcidid":"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0220-0482","gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Developer"],"note":null},{"name":"Eduardo Rocha","email":"eduardo.rocha@pasteur.fr","url":"https://research.pasteur.fr/fr/member/eduardo-rocha/","orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Support"],"note":null},{"name":"Microbial Evolutionary Genomics","email":null,"url":"https://research.pasteur.fr/en/team/microbial-evolutionary-genomics/","orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Division","typeRole":[],"note":"CNRS - UMR 352"},{"name":"Jean Cury","email":"jean.cury@normalesup.org","url":null,"orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Primary contact"],"note":null},{"name":"Bertrand Neron","email":"bneron@pasteur.fr","url":null,"orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Primary contact"],"note":null},{"name":"Eduardo Rocha","email":"eduardo.rocha@pasteur.fr","url":"https://research.pasteur.fr/fr/member/eduardo-rocha/","orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Primary contact"],"note":null},{"name":"Eloi Littner","email":"eloi.littner@pasteur.fr","url":null,"orcidid":"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8793-9584","gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Contributor"],"note":null},{"name":"Matthieu Haudiquet","email":null,"url":null,"orcidid":"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0878-2209","gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Contributor"],"note":null},{"name":"Amandine PERRIN","email":null,"url":null,"orcidid":"https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4797-6185","gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Contributor"],"note":null},{"name":"INCEPTION","email":null,"url":"https://anr.fr/ProjetIA-16-CONV-0005","orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Funding agency","typeRole":["Contributor"],"note":null},{"name":"Laboratoire d’Excellence IBEID Integrative Biology of Emerging Infectious Diseases","email":null,"url":"https://anr.fr/ProjetIA-10-LABX-0062","orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Funding agency","typeRole":["Contributor"],"note":null}],"community":null,"owner":"jeanrjc","additionDate":"2016-11-28T10:07:17Z","lastUpdate":"2024-06-06T08:09:34.015441Z","editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["hmenager","khillion","bneron"]},"validated":1,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":null}
