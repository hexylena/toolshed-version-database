The rapid growth in virus genome data production has necessitated the development of new analytical methods that can deal with orders of magnitude of more genomes than previously available. Here, we present and describe Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak Lineages (pangolin), a computational tool that has been developed to assign the most likely lineage to a given SARSCoV-2 genome sequence according to the Pango dynamic lineage nomenclature scheme. To date, nearly two million virus genomes have been submitted to the web-application implementation of pangolin, which has facilitated the SARS-CoV-2 genomic epidemiology and provided researchers with access to actionable information about the pandemic’s transmission lineages.","date":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","citationCount":528,"authors":[{"name":"O'Toole A."},{"name":"Scher E."},{"name":"Underwood A."},{"name":"Jackson B."},{"name":"Hill V."},{"name":"McCrone J.T."},{"name":"Colquhoun R."},{"name":"Ruis C."},{"name":"Abu-Dahab K."},{"name":"Taylor B."},{"name":"Yeats C."},{"name":"du Plessis L."},{"name":"Maloney D."},{"name":"Medd N."},{"name":"Attwood S.W."},{"name":"Aanensen D.M."},{"name":"Holmes E.C."},{"name":"Pybus O.G."},{"name":"Rambaut A."}],"journal":"Virus Evolution"}}],"credit":[{"name":"Áine O'Toole","email":null,"url":null,"orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Developer"],"note":null}],"community":null,"owner":"wm75","additionDate":"2024-03-27T12:31:52.492448Z","lastUpdate":"2024-03-27T12:45:41.622372Z","editPermission":{"type":"public","authors":[]},"validated":0,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":null}
