ColabFold’s 40−60-fold faster search and optimized model utilization enables prediction of close to 1,000 structures per day on a server with one graphics processing unit. Coupled with Google Colaboratory, ColabFold becomes a free and accessible platform for protein folding. ColabFold is open-source software available at https://github.com/sokrypton/ColabFold and its novel environmental databases are available at https://colabfold.mmseqs.com.","date":"2022-06-01T00:00:00Z","citationCount":795,"authors":[{"name":"Mirdita M."},{"name":"Schutze K."},{"name":"Moriwaki Y."},{"name":"Heo L."},{"name":"Ovchinnikov S."},{"name":"Steinegger M."}],"journal":"Nature Methods"}},{"doi":"10.1101/2021.08.15.456425","pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"type":[],"version":null,"note":null,"metadata":null}],"credit":[{"name":"Martin Steinegger","email":"martin.steinegger@snu.ac.kr","url":null,"orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":[],"note":null}],"community":null,"owner":"milot-mirdita","additionDate":"2021-12-19T16:47:34.609609Z","lastUpdate":"2023-06-23T08:49:51.590398Z","editPermission":{"type":"public","authors":[]},"validated":1,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":"tool"}
