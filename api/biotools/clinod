{"name":"clinod","description":"The command line NoD predictor (clinod) can be run from the command line to predict Nucleolar localization sequences (NoLSs) that are short targeting sequences responsible for the localization of proteins to the nucleolus.\nThe predictor accepts a list of FASTA formatted sequences as an input and outputs the NOLS predictions as a result.\nPlease note that currently, JPred secondary structure predictions are not supported by clinod. However, we are working on it.","homepage":"https://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/www-nod/cli_help.jsp","biotoolsID":"clinod","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:clinod","version":[],"otherID":[],"relation":[],"function":[{"operation":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2478","term":"Nucleic acid sequence analysis"}],"input":[],"output":[],"note":null,"cmd":null}],"toolType":[],"topic":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0080","term":"Sequence analysis"}],"operatingSystem":[],"language":[],"license":null,"collectionID":[],"maturity":null,"cost":null,"accessibility":null,"elixirPlatform":[],"elixirNode":[],"elixirCommunity":[],"link":[],"download":[],"documentation":[],"publication":[],"credit":[],"community":null,"owner":"paulzierep","additionDate":"2024-03-12T13:48:56.972279Z","lastUpdate":"2024-03-12T13:48:56.975036Z","editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"validated":0,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":null}
