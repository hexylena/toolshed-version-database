{"name":"scp","description":"Utility functions for manipulating, processing, and analyzing mass spectrometry-based single-cell proteomics data. The package is an extension to the 'QFeatures' package and relies on 'SingleCellExpirement' to enable single-cell proteomics analyses. The package offers the user the functionality to process quantitative table (as generated by MaxQuant, Proteome Discoverer, and more) into data tables ready for downstream analysis and data visualization.","homepage":"https://uclouvain-cbio.github.io/scp/","biotoolsID":"scp","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:scp","version":["1.16.0"],"otherID":[],"relation":[],"function":[{"operation":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0337","term":"Visualisation"}],"input":[],"output":[],"note":null,"cmd":null},{"operation":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2495","term":"Expression analysis"}],"input":[],"output":[],"note":null,"cmd":null}],"toolType":["Library"],"topic":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520","term":"Proteomics experiment"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121","term":"Proteomics"}],"operatingSystem":["Mac","Linux","Windows"],"language":["R"],"license":null,"collectionID":[],"maturity":null,"cost":"Free of charge","accessibility":"Open access","elixirPlatform":[],"elixirNode":[],"elixirCommunity":[],"link":[],"download":[],"documentation":[],"publication":[],"credit":[],"community":null,"owner":"recetox-specdatri","additionDate":"2025-01-09T15:45:12.825558Z","lastUpdate":"2025-01-11T12:06:29.826828Z","editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"validated":0,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":"tool"}
