We show a good performance of the maSigPro-GLM method in several simulated time-course scenarios and in a real experimental dataset.Availability and implementation: The package is freely available under the LGPL license from the Bioconductor Web site (http://bioconductor.org).","date":"2014-09-15T00:00:00Z","citationCount":126,"authors":[{"name":"Nueda M.J."},{"name":"Tarazona S."},{"name":"Conesa A."}],"journal":"Bioinformatics"}}],"credit":[{"name":"Maria Jose Nueda","email":"mj.nueda@ua.es","url":null,"orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Primary contact"],"note":null}],"community":null,"owner":"bioconductor_import","additionDate":"2017-01-17T15:05:16Z","lastUpdate":"2018-12-10T12:58:51Z","editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"validated":1,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":null}
