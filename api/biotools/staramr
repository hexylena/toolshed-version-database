{"name":"staramr","description":"staramr (*AMR) scans bacterial genome contigs against the ResFinder, PointFinder, and PlasmidFinder databases (used by the ResFinder webservice and other webservices offered by the Center for Genomic Epidemiology) and compiles a summary report of detected antimicrobial resistance genes. The star|* in staramr indicates that it can handle all of the ResFinder, PointFinder, and PlasmidFinder databases.","homepage":"https://github.com/phac-nml/staramr","biotoolsID":"staramr","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:staramr","version":[],"otherID":[],"relation":[],"function":[{"operation":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3482","term":"Antimicrobial resistance prediction"}],"input":[],"output":[],"note":null,"cmd":null}],"toolType":[],"topic":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3301","term":"Microbiology"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3305","term":"Public health and epidemiology"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3324","term":"Infectious disease"}],"operatingSystem":[],"language":[],"license":null,"collectionID":[],"maturity":null,"cost":null,"accessibility":null,"elixirPlatform":[],"elixirNode":[],"elixirCommunity":[],"link":[],"download":[],"documentation":[],"publication":[],"credit":[],"community":null,"owner":"bebatut","additionDate":"2024-03-12T11:20:21.053518Z","lastUpdate":"2024-03-12T11:20:21.057313Z","editPermission":{"type":"public","authors":[]},"validated":0,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":null}
