{"name":"usher","description":"The UShER toolkit includes a set of tools for for rapid, accurate placement of samples to existing phylogenies. While not restricted to SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic analyses, it has enabled real-time phylogenetic analyses and genomic contact tracing in that its placement is orders of magnitude faster and more memory-efficient than previous methods.","homepage":"https://github.com/yatisht/usher","biotoolsID":"usher","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:usher","version":["0.2.1"],"otherID":[],"relation":[],"function":[{"operation":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2990","term":"Classification"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0567","term":"Phylogenetic tree visualisation"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0540","term":"Phylogenetic inference (from molecular sequences)"}],"input":[],"output":[],"note":null,"cmd":null}],"toolType":["Command-line tool"],"topic":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0084","term":"Phylogeny"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3299","term":"Evolutionary biology"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3944","term":"Cladistics"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0625","term":"Genotype and phenotype"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0194","term":"Phylogenomics"}],"operatingSystem":[],"language":["C++","Python"],"license":"MIT","collectionID":[],"maturity":"Mature","cost":"Free of charge","accessibility":"Open access","elixirPlatform":[],"elixirNode":[],"elixirCommunity":[],"link":[],"download":[],"documentation":[],"publication":[],"credit":[],"community":null,"owner":"rlibouban","additionDate":"2024-03-12T14:25:30.909146Z","lastUpdate":"2024-03-12T14:36:05.717126Z","editPermission":{"type":"public","authors":[]},"validated":0,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":null}
