{"name":"HybPiper","description":"Paralogs and off-target sequences improve phylogenetic resolution in a densely-sampled study of the breadfruit genus (Artocarpus, Moraceae).\n\nRecovering genes from targeted sequence capture data.\n\nCurrent version: 1.3.1 (August 2018).\n\n-- Read our article in Applications in Plant Sciences (Open Access).\n\nHybPiper was designed for targeted sequence capture, in which DNA sequencing libraries are enriched for gene regions of interest, especially for phylogenetics. HybPiper is a suite of Python scripts that wrap and connect bioinformatics tools in order to extract target sequences from high-throughput DNA sequencing reads.","homepage":"https://github.com/mossmatters/HybPiper","biotoolsID":"HybPiper","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:HybPiper","version":[],"otherID":[],"relation":[],"function":[{"operation":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3192","term":"Sequence trimming"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0310","term":"Sequence assembly"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3198","term":"Read mapping"}],"input":[],"output":[],"note":null,"cmd":null}],"toolType":["Command-line tool"],"topic":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3293","term":"Phylogenetics"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0780","term":"Plant biology"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3512","term":"Gene transcripts"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0196","term":"Sequence assembly"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0194","term":"Phylogenomics"}],"operatingSystem":[],"language":["Python"],"license":"GPL-3.0","collectionID":[],"maturity":null,"cost":null,"accessibility":null,"elixirPlatform":[],"elixirNode":[],"elixirCommunity":[],"link":[],"download":[],"documentation":[],"publication":[{"doi":"10.1101/854232","pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"type":[],"version":null,"note":null,"metadata":null}],"credit":[],"community":null,"owner":"Pub2Tools","additionDate":"2020-01-14T09:37:34Z","lastUpdate":"2020-12-11T07:51:04Z","editPermission":{"type":"public","authors":[]},"validated":1,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":"tool"}
