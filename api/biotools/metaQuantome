Metaproteomics, the study of microbial proteins at the community level, integrates genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data to determine the taxonomic and functional state of a microbiome. However, standard metaproteomics software is subject to several limitations, commonly supporting only spectral counts, emphasizing exploratory analysis rather than hypothesis testing and rarely offering the ability to analyze the interaction of function and taxonomy - that is, which taxa are responsible for different processes. Here we present metaQuantome, a novel, multifaceted software suite that analyzes the state of a microbiome by leveraging complex taxonomic and functional hierarchies to summarize peptide-level quantitative information, emphasizing label-free intensity-based methods. For experiments with multiple experimental conditions, metaQuantome offers differential abundance analysis, principal components analysis, and clustered heat map visualizations, as well as exploratory analysis for a single sample or experimental condition. We benchmark meta- Quantome analysis against standard methods, using two previously published datasets: (1) an artificially assembled microbial community dataset (taxonomy benchmarking) and (2) a dataset with a range of recombinant human proteins spiked into an Escherichia coli background (functional benchmarking). Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of metaQuantome on a previously published human oral microbiome dataset. In both the taxonomic and functional benchmarking analyses, metaQuantome quantified taxonomic and functional terms more accurately than standard summarization- based methods. We use the oral microbiome dataset to demonstrate metaQuantome's ability to produce publication- quality figures and elucidate biological processes of the oral microbiome. metaQuantome enables advanced investigation of metaproteomic datasets, which should be broadly applicable to microbiome-related research. In the interest of accessible, flexible, and reproducible analysis, metaQuantome is open source and available on the command line and in Galaxy.","date":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","citationCount":11,"authors":[{"name":"Easterly C.W."},{"name":"Sajulga R."},{"name":"Mehta S."},{"name":"Johnson J."},{"name":"Kumar P."},{"name":"Hubler S."},{"name":"Mesuere B."},{"name":"Rudney J."},{"name":"Griffin T.J."},{"name":"Jagtap P.D."}],"journal":"Molecular and Cellular Proteomics"}},{"doi":"10.1021/ACS.JPROTEOME.0C00960","pmid":"33683127","pmcid":null,"type":[],"version":null,"note":null,"metadata":{"title":"Updates on metaQuantome Software for Quantitative Metaproteomics","abstract":"© 2021 American Chemical Society.metaQuantome is a software suite that enables the quantitative analysis, statistical evaluation. and visualization of mass-spectrometry-based metaproteomics data. In the latest update of this software, we have provided several extensions, including a step-by-step training guide, the ability to perform statistical analysis on samples from multiple conditions, and a comparative analysis of metatranscriptomics data. The training module, accessed via the Galaxy Training Network, will help users to use the suite effectively both for functional as well as for taxonomic analysis. We extend the ability of metaQuantome to now perform multi-data-point quantitative and statistical analyses so that studies with measurements across multiple conditions, such as time-course studies, can be analyzed. With an eye on the multiomics analysis of microbial communities, we have also initiated the use of metaQuantome statistical and visualization tools on outputs from metatranscriptomics data, which complements the metagenomic and metaproteomic analyses already available. For this, we have developed a tool named MT2MQ (\"metatranscriptomics to metaQuantome\"), which takes in outputs from the ASaiM metatranscriptomics workflow and transforms them so that the data can be used as an input for comparative statistical analysis and visualization via metaQuantome. We believe that these improvements to metaQuantome will facilitate the use of the software for quantitative metaproteomics and metatranscriptomics and will enable multipoint data analysis. These improvements will take us a step toward integrative multiomic microbiome analysis so as to understand dynamic taxonomic and functional responses of these complex systems in a variety of biological contexts. The updated metaQuantome and MT2MQ are open-source software and are available via the Galaxy Toolshed and GitHub.","date":"2021-04-02T00:00:00Z","citationCount":0,"authors":[{"name":"Mehta S."},{"name":"Kumar P."},{"name":"Crane M."},{"name":"Johnson J.E."},{"name":"Sajulga R."},{"name":"Nguyen D.D.A."},{"name":"McGowan T."},{"name":"Arntzen M."},{"name":"Griffin T.J."},{"name":"Jagtap P.D."}],"journal":"Journal of Proteome Research"}}],"credit":[],"community":null,"owner":"pjagtap","additionDate":"2020-03-10T11:06:45Z","lastUpdate":"2021-05-27T07:59:11Z","editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"validated":1,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":"tool"}
