{"name":"ChIPseeker","description":"This package implements functions to retrieve the nearest genes around the peak, annotate the genomic region of the peak, statistical methods for estimating the significance of overlap among ChIP peak data sets, and incorporate GEO database to compare the own dataset with those deposited in database. The comparison can be used to infer cooperative regulation and thus can be used to generate hypotheses.","homepage":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ChIPseeker.html","biotoolsID":"chipseeker","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:chipseeker","version":["1.10.3"],"otherID":[],"relation":[],"function":[{"operation":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0361","term":"Sequence annotation"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0337","term":"Visualisation"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2436","term":"Gene-set enrichment analysis"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0256","term":"Sequence feature comparison"}],"input":[{"data":{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_2012","term":"Sequence coordinates"},"format":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3003","term":"BED"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2078","term":"Sequence range format"}]}],"output":[{"data":{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_2884","term":"Plot"},"format":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2330","term":"Textual format"}]},{"data":{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_1276","term":"Nucleic acid features"},"format":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2330","term":"Textual format"}]}],"note":null,"cmd":null}],"toolType":["Command-line tool","Library"],"topic":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3169","term":"ChIP-seq"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0092","term":"Data visualisation"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3473","term":"Data mining"}],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"language":["R"],"license":"Artistic-2.0","collectionID":["BioConductor"],"maturity":null,"cost":null,"accessibility":null,"elixirPlatform":[],"elixirNode":[],"elixirCommunity":[],"link":[{"url":"https://guangchuangyu.github.io/ChIPseeker","type":["Mirror"],"note":null}],"download":[{"url":"http://bioconductor/packages/release/bioc/src/contrib/ChIPseeker_1.10.3.tar.gz","type":"Source code","note":null,"version":null}],"documentation":[{"url":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ChIPseeker.html","type":["User manual"],"note":null}],"publication":[{"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btv145","pmid":"25765347","pmcid":null,"type":["Primary"],"version":null,"note":null,"metadata":{"title":"ChIP seeker: An R/Bioconductor package for ChIP peak annotation, comparison and visualization","abstract":"Â© The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.Summary: ChIPseeker is an R package for annotating ChIP-seq data analysis. It supports annotating ChIP peaks and provides functions to visualize ChIP peaks coverage over chromosomes and profiles of peaks binding to TSS regions. Comparison of ChIP peak profiles and annotation are also supported. Moreover, it supports evaluating significant overlap among ChIP-seq datasets. Currently, ChIPseeker contains 15 000 bed file information from GEO database. These datasets can be downloaded and compare with user's own data to explore significant overlap datasets for inferring co-regulation or transcription factor complex for further investigation.","date":"2015-07-15T00:00:00Z","citationCount":607,"authors":[{"name":"Yu G."},{"name":"Wang L.-G."},{"name":"He Q.-Y."}],"journal":"Bioinformatics"}}],"credit":[{"name":"Guangchuang Yu","email":"guangchuangyu@gmail.com","url":null,"orcidid":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6485-8781","gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Primary contact"],"note":null}],"community":null,"owner":"bioconductor_import","additionDate":"2017-01-17T14:55:17Z","lastUpdate":"2019-01-11T00:23:52Z","editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"validated":1,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":null}
