However, the construction of computational pipelines that use different software packages is difficult owing to a lack of interoperability, reproducibility and transparency. To overcome these limitations we present Orione, a Galaxy-based framework consisting of publicly available research software and specifically designed pipelines to build complex, reproducible workflows for next-generation sequencing microbiology data analysis. Enabling microbiology researchers to conduct their own custom analysis and data manipulation without software installation or programming, Orione provides new opportunities for data-intensive computational analyses in microbiology and metagenomics. © The Author 2014.","date":"2014-07-01T00:00:00Z","citationCount":84,"authors":[{"name":"Cuccuru G."},{"name":"Orsini M."},{"name":"Pinna A."},{"name":"Sbardellati A."},{"name":"Soranzo N."},{"name":"Travaglione A."},{"name":"Uva P."},{"name":"Zanetti G."},{"name":"Fotia G."}],"journal":"Bioinformatics"}},{"doi":"10.1093/nar/gkw343","pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"type":["Other"],"version":null,"note":null,"metadata":{"title":"The Galaxy platform for accessible, reproducible and collaborative biomedical analyses: 2016 update","abstract":"© The Author(s) 2016. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.High-throughput data production technologies, particularly 'next-generation' DNA sequencing, have ushered in widespread and disruptive changes to biomedical research. Making sense of the large datasets produced by these technologies requires sophisticated statistical and computational methods, as well as substantial computational power. This has led to an acute crisis in life sciences, as researchers without informatics training attempt to perform computation-dependent analyses. Since 2005, the Galaxy project has worked to address this problem by providing a framework that makes advanced computational tools usable by non experts. Galaxy seeks to make data-intensive research more accessible, transparent and reproducible by providing a Web-based environment in which users can perform computational analyses and have all of the details automatically tracked for later inspection, publication, or reuse. In this report we highlight recently added features enabling biomedical analyses on a large scale.","date":"2016-07-08T00:00:00Z","citationCount":1025,"authors":[{"name":"Afgan E."},{"name":"Baker D."},{"name":"van den Beek M."},{"name":"Blankenberg D."},{"name":"Bouvier D."},{"name":"Cech M."},{"name":"Chilton J."},{"name":"Clements D."},{"name":"Coraor N."},{"name":"Eberhard C."},{"name":"Gruning B."},{"name":"Guerler A."},{"name":"Hillman-Jackson J."},{"name":"Von Kuster G."},{"name":"Rasche E."},{"name":"Soranzo N."},{"name":"Turaga N."},{"name":"Taylor J."},{"name":"Nekrutenko A."},{"name":"Goecks J."}],"journal":"Nucleic acids research"}},{"doi":"10.7490/f1000research.1114334.1","pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"type":["Other"],"version":null,"note":null,"metadata":null}],"credit":[{"name":"Galaxy Support Team","email":"galaxy@pasteur.fr","url":null,"orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Primary contact"],"note":null}],"community":null,"owner":"hmenager","additionDate":"2016-12-19T14:26:24Z","lastUpdate":"2020-06-16T10:55:20Z","editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"validated":1,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":null}
