In addition to the traditional web form based interfaces, APIs exist for core data resources such as EMBL-Bank, Ensembl, UniProt, InterPro, PDB and ArrayExpress. These APIs are based on Web Services (SOAP/REST) interfaces that allow users to systematically access databases and analytical tools. From the user's point of view, these Web Services provide the same functionality as the browser-based forms. However, using the APIs frees the user from web page constraints and are ideal for the analysis of large batches of data, performing text-mining tasks and the casual or systematic evaluation of mathematical models in regulatory networks. Furthermore, these services are widespread and easy to use; require no prior knowledge of the technology and no more than basic experience in programming. In the following we wish to inform of new and updated services as well as briefly describe planned developments to be made available during the course of 2009-2010.","date":"2009-08-04T00:00:00Z","citationCount":62,"authors":[{"name":"Mcwilliam H."},{"name":"Valentin F."},{"name":"Goujon M."},{"name":"Li W."},{"name":"Narayanasamy M."},{"name":"Martin J."},{"name":"Miyar T."},{"name":"Lopez R."}],"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research"}},{"doi":"10.1093/nar/gkh405","pmid":"15215339","pmcid":"PMC441543","type":["Primary"],"version":null,"note":null,"metadata":{"title":"Public web-based services from the European Bioinformatics Institute","abstract":"The mission of the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI), an outstation of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) in Heidelberg, is to ensure that the growing body of information from molecular biology and genome research is placed in the public domain and is accessible freely to all parts of the scientific community in ways that promote scientific progress. To fulfil this mission, the EBI provides a wide variety of free, publicly available bioinformatics services. These can be divided into data submissions processing; access to query, analysis and retrieval systems and tools; ftp downloads of software and databases; training and education and user support. All of these services are available at the EBI website: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/services. This paper provides a detailed introduction to the interactive analysis systems that are available from the EBI and a brief introduction to other, related services.
