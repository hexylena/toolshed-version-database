{"name":"DeepVariant","description":"DeepVariant is a deep learning-based variant caller that takes aligned reads (in BAM or CRAM format), produces pileup image tensors from them, classifies each tensor using a convolutional neural network, and finally reports the results in a standard VCF or gVCF file.","homepage":"https://github.com/google/deepvariant","biotoolsID":"deepvariant","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:deepvariant","version":[],"otherID":[],"relation":[],"function":[{"operation":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3227","term":"Variant calling"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3196","term":"Genotyping"}],"input":[],"output":[],"note":null,"cmd":null}],"toolType":[],"topic":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3673","term":"Whole genome sequencing"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3676","term":"Exome sequencing"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0625","term":"Genotype and phenotype"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0622","term":"Genomics"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_2885","term":"DNA polymorphism"}],"operatingSystem":[],"language":["Python","C++","Shell"],"license":"BSD-3-Clause","collectionID":[],"maturity":null,"cost":null,"accessibility":null,"elixirPlatform":[],"elixirNode":[],"elixirCommunity":[],"link":[{"url":"https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues","type":["Issue tracker"],"note":null}],"download":[{"url":"https://hub.docker.com/r/google/deepvariant","type":"Container file","note":null,"version":null}],"documentation":[],"publication":[{"doi":"10.1093/BIOINFORMATICS/BTAA1081","pmid":"33399819","pmcid":null,"type":[],"version":null,"note":null,"metadata":{"title":"Accurate, scalable cohort variant calls using DeepVariant and GLnexus","abstract":"Â© 2021 The Author(s) 2021. Published by Oxford University Press.Motivation: Population-scale sequenced cohorts are foundational resources for genetic analyses, but processing raw reads into analysis-ready cohort-level variants remains challenging. Results: We introduce an open-source cohort-calling method that uses the highly accurate caller DeepVariant and scalable merging tool GLnexus. Using callset quality metrics based on variant recall and precision in benchmark samples and Mendelian consistency in father-mother-child trios, we optimize the method across a range of cohort sizes, sequencing methods and sequencing depths. The resulting callsets show consistent quality improvements over those generated using existing best practices with reduced cost. We further evaluate our pipeline in the deeply sequenced 1000 Genomes Project (1KGP) samples and show superior callset quality metrics and imputation reference panel performance compared to an independently generated GATK Best Practices pipeline.","date":"2020-12-15T00:00:00Z","citationCount":1,"authors":[{"name":"Yun T."},{"name":"Li H."},{"name":"Chang P.-C."},{"name":"Lin M.F."},{"name":"Carroll A."},{"name":"McLean C.Y."}],"journal":"Bioinformatics"}}],"credit":[{"name":"Cory Y McLean","email":"cym@google.com","url":null,"orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":[],"note":null}],"community":null,"owner":"Kigaard","additionDate":"2021-03-19T08:49:27Z","lastUpdate":"2021-03-27T19:56:47Z","editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"validated":0,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":"tool"}
