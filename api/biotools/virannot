No universally accepted strategy or tool currently exists to define operational taxonomy units (OTUs) and evaluate viral alpha or beta diversity from virome data. Here we present a new bioinformatic resource, the VirAnnot (automated viral diversity estimation) pipeline, which performs the automated identification of OTUs. Reverse-position-specific BLAST (RPS-Blastn) is used to detect conserved viral protein motifs. The corresponding contigs are then aligned and a clustering approach is used to group in the same OTU contigs sharing more than a set identity threshold. A 10% threshold has been validated as producing OTUs that reasonably approach, in many families, the International Committee for the Taxonomy of Viruses taxonomy and can therefore be used as a proxy to viral species.","date":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","citationCount":10,"authors":[{"name":"Lefebvre M."},{"name":"Theil S."},{"name":"Ma Y."},{"name":"Candresse T."}],"journal":"Phytobiomes Journal"}}],"credit":[{"name":"INRAE UMR 1332","email":"marie.lefebvre@inrae.fr","url":null,"orcidid":"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3093-5873","gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Developer","Primary contact"],"note":null},{"name":"Université de Bordeaux","email":null,"url":null,"orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Institute","typeRole":[],"note":null},{"name":"Sebastien Theil","email":null,"url":null,"orcidid":"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7361-4159","gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Developer"],"note":null},{"name":"Thierry Candresse","email":"thierry.candresse@inrae.fr","url":null,"orcidid":"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9757-1835","gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":[],"note":null}],"community":null,"owner":"marieBvr","additionDate":"2020-10-15T14:49:18Z","lastUpdate":"2020-10-21T07:40:49Z","editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"validated":1,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":null}
