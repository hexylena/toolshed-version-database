This recently developed approach to ecosystem study relies heavily on the use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) and thus calls upon the ability to deal with huge sequence data sets. The obitools package satisfies this requirement thanks to a set of programs specifically designed for analysing NGS data in a DNA metabarcoding context. Their capacity to filter and edit sequences while taking into account taxonomic annotation helps to set up tailor-made analysis pipelines for a broad range of DNA metabarcoding applications, including biodiversity surveys or diet analyses. The obitools package is distributed as an open source software available on the following website: http://metabarcoding.org/obitools. A Galaxy wrapper is available on the GenOuest core facility toolshed: http://toolshed.genouest.org.","date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","citationCount":366,"authors":[{"name":"Boyer F."},{"name":"Mercier C."},{"name":"Bonin A."},{"name":"Le Bras Y."},{"name":"Taberlet P."},{"name":"Coissac E."}],"journal":"Molecular Ecology Resources"}}],"credit":[{"name":"Eric Coissac","email":"eric.coissac@inria.fr","url":"http://metabarcoding.org/obitools","orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Primary contact"],"note":null}],"community":null,"owner":"mbs_import","additionDate":"2017-08-03T18:52:54Z","lastUpdate":"2018-12-10T12:58:51Z","editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"validated":1,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":null}
