{"name":"Diamond","description":"Sequence aligner for protein and translated DNA searches and functions as a drop-in replacement for the NCBI BLAST software tools. It is suitable for protein-protein search as well as DNA-protein search on short reads and longer sequences including contigs and assemblies, providing a speedup of BLAST ranging up to x20,000.","homepage":"https://github.com/bbuchfink/diamond","biotoolsID":"diamond","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:diamond","version":[],"otherID":[{"value":"RRID:SCR_016071","type":"rrid","version":null}],"relation":[],"function":[{"operation":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0258","term":"Sequence alignment analysis"}],"input":[],"output":[],"note":null,"cmd":null}],"toolType":["Command-line tool"],"topic":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0080","term":"Sequence analysis"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0078","term":"Proteins"}],"operatingSystem":["Linux"],"language":["Shell"],"license":"AGPL-3.0","collectionID":["Animal and Crop Genomics"],"maturity":null,"cost":null,"accessibility":null,"elixirPlatform":[],"elixirNode":[],"elixirCommunity":[],"link":[{"url":"https://github.com/bbuchfink/diamond/issues","type":["Issue tracker"],"note":null}],"download":[],"documentation":[{"url":"https://github.com/bbuchfink/diamond/blob/master/diamond_manual.pdf","type":["User manual"],"note":null}],"publication":[{"doi":"10.1038/nmeth.3176","pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"type":["Primary"],"version":null,"note":null,"metadata":{"title":"Fast and sensitive protein alignment using DIAMOND","abstract":"The alignment of sequencing reads against a protein reference database is a major computational bottleneck in metagenomics and data-intensive evolutionary projects. Although recent tools offer improved performance over the gold standard BLASTX, they exhibit only a modest speedup or low sensitivity. We introduce DIAMOND, an open-source algorithm based on double indexing that is 20,000 times faster than BLASTX on short reads and has a similar degree of sensitivity.","date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00Z","citationCount":2548,"authors":[{"name":"Buchfink B."},{"name":"Xie C."},{"name":"Huson D.H."}],"journal":"Nature Methods"}}],"credit":[{"name":null,"email":"buchfink@gmail.com","url":null,"orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Primary contact"],"note":null}],"community":null,"owner":"admin","additionDate":"2017-08-20T15:31:49Z","lastUpdate":"2021-04-17T18:46:48Z","editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["animalandcropgenomics"]},"validated":1,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":null}
