{"name":"Nanocompore","description":"RNA modifications detection by comparative Nanopore direct RNA sequencing.\n\nRNA modifications detection from Nanopore dRNA-Seq data.\n\nNanocompore identifies differences in ONT nanopore sequencing raw signal corresponding to RNA modifications by comparing 2 samples.\n\nAnalyses performed for the nanocompore paper.\n\nNanocompore compares 2 ONT nanopore direct RNA sequencing datasets from different experimental conditions expected to have a significant impact on RNA modifications. It is recommended to have at least 2 replicates per condition. For example one can use a control condition with a significantly reduced number of modifications such as a cell line for which a modification writing enzyme was knocked-down or knocked-out. Alternatively, on a smaller scale transcripts of interests could be synthesized in-vitro","homepage":"https://github.com/tleonardi/nanocompore","biotoolsID":"Nanocompore","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:Nanocompore","version":[],"otherID":[],"relation":[],"function":[{"operation":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0417","term":"Post-translation modification site prediction"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0428","term":"PolyA signal detection"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3196","term":"Genotyping"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3472","term":"k-mer counting"}],"input":[],"output":[],"note":null,"cmd":null}],"toolType":["Command-line tool"],"topic":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0659","term":"Functional, regulatory and non-coding RNA"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3170","term":"RNA-Seq"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3512","term":"Gene transcripts"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3308","term":"Transcriptomics"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0749","term":"Transcription factors and regulatory sites"}],"operatingSystem":[],"language":["Python"],"license":"GPL-3.0","collectionID":[],"maturity":null,"cost":null,"accessibility":null,"elixirPlatform":[],"elixirNode":[],"elixirCommunity":[],"link":[{"url":"https://github.com/tleonardi/nanocompore_paper_analyses/","type":["Repository"],"note":null}],"download":[],"documentation":[],"publication":[{"doi":"10.1101/843136","pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"type":[],"version":null,"note":null,"metadata":null}],"credit":[],"community":null,"owner":"Pub2Tools","additionDate":"2020-01-14T09:05:22Z","lastUpdate":"2023-11-02T09:05:36.159032Z","editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["ELIXIR-CZ"]},"validated":1,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":"tool"}
