{"name":"TSEBRA","description":"TSEBRA is a combiner tool that selects transcripts from gene predictions based on the support by extrisic evidence in form of introns and start/stop codons. It was developed to combine BRAKER1 and BRAKER2 predicitons to increase their accuracies.","homepage":"https://github.com/Gaius-Augustus/TSEBRA","biotoolsID":"tsebra","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:tsebra","version":[],"otherID":[],"relation":[],"function":[{"operation":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3663","term":"Homology-based gene prediction"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0264","term":"Alternative splicing prediction"}],"input":[],"output":[],"note":null,"cmd":null}],"toolType":["Command-line tool"],"topic":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0203","term":"Gene expression"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3170","term":"RNA-Seq"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3512","term":"Gene transcripts"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0621","term":"Model organisms"}],"operatingSystem":["Mac","Windows","Linux"],"language":["Python","Shell"],"license":"Artistic-2.0","collectionID":[],"maturity":null,"cost":"Free of charge","accessibility":"Open access","elixirPlatform":[],"elixirNode":[],"elixirCommunity":[],"link":[],"download":[{"url":"https://github.com/Gaius-Augustus/TSEBRA","type":"Downloads page","note":null,"version":null}],"documentation":[{"url":"https://github.com/Gaius-Augustus/TSEBRA","type":["General"],"note":null}],"publication":[{"doi":"10.1101/2021.06.07.447316","pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"type":[],"version":null,"note":null,"metadata":null}],"credit":[{"name":"Mario Stanke","email":"mario.stanke@uni-greifswald.de","url":null,"orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":[],"note":null}],"community":null,"owner":"Jennifer","additionDate":"2021-10-12T12:05:36.244875Z","lastUpdate":"2021-10-12T12:05:36.247365Z","editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"validated":1,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":"tool"}
