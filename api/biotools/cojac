{"name":"COJAC","description":"CoOccurrence adJusted Analysis and Calling - The cojac package comprises a set of command-line tools to analyse co-occurrence of mutations on amplicons. It is useful, for example, for early detection of viral variants of concern (e.g. Alpha, Delta, Omicron) in environmental samples, and has been designed to scan for multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants in wastewater samples, as analyzed jointly by ETH Zurich, EPFL and Eawag.","homepage":"https://github.com/cbg-ethz/cojac","biotoolsID":"cojac","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:cojac","version":[],"otherID":[],"relation":[],"function":[],"toolType":["Command-line tool"],"topic":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0199","term":"Genetic variation"}],"operatingSystem":[],"language":[],"license":"GPL-3.0","collectionID":["COVID-19"],"maturity":null,"cost":null,"accessibility":null,"elixirPlatform":[],"elixirNode":[],"elixirCommunity":[],"link":[{"url":"https://github.com/cbg-ethz/cojac","type":["Repository"],"note":null},{"url":"https://github.com/cbg-ethz/cojac/issues","type":["Issue tracker"],"note":null}],"download":[],"documentation":[],"publication":[{"doi":"10.1101/2021.01.08.21249379","pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"type":[],"version":null,"note":null,"metadata":null}],"credit":[],"community":null,"owner":"DrYak","additionDate":"2022-08-11T13:23:52.433073Z","lastUpdate":"2023-11-02T09:06:30.325929Z","editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["ELIXIR-CZ"]},"validated":0,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":null}
