Here, we demonstrate new software, Morpheus, designed specifically for high-mass accuracy data, based on a simple score that is little more than the number of matching products. For a diverse collection of data sets from a variety of organisms (E. coli, yeast, human) acquired on a variety of instruments (quadrupole-time-of-flight, ion trap-orbitrap, and quadrupole-orbitrap) in different laboratories, Morpheus gives more spectrum, peptide, and protein identifications at a 1% false discovery rate (FDR) than Mascot, Open Mass Spectrometry Search Algorithm (OMSSA), and Sequest. Additionally, Morpheus is 1.5 to 4.6 times faster, depending on the data set, than the next fastest algorithm, OMSSA. Morpheus was developed in C#.NET and is available free and open source under a permissive license.
