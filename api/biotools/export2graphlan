We developed GraPhlAn (Graphical Phylogenetic Analysis), a computational tool that produces high-quality, compact visualizations of microbial genomes and metagenomes. This includes phylogenies spanning up to thousands of taxa, annotated with metadata ranging from microbial community abundances to microbial physiology or host and environmental phenotypes. GraPhlAn has been developed as an open-source command-driven tool in order to be easily integrated into complex, publicationquality bioinformatics pipelines. It can be executed either locally or through an online Galaxy web application. We present several examples including taxonomic and phylogenetic visualization of microbial communities, metabolic functions, and biomarker discovery that illustrate GraPhlAn's potential for modern microbial and community genomics.","date":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","citationCount":295,"authors":[{"name":"Asnicar F."},{"name":"Weingart G."},{"name":"Tickle T.L."},{"name":"Huttenhower C."},{"name":"Segata N."}],"journal":"PeerJ"}}],"credit":[{"name":"Segata Lab","email":"nicola.segata@unitn.it","url":"http://segatalab.cibio.unitn.it/","orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Division","typeRole":["Primary contact"],"note":"The computational metagenomics lab at the Dep.
