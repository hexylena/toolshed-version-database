Published by Oxford University Press.SUMMARY: In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in bacteriophages, which has led to growing numbers of bacteriophage genomic sequences becoming available. Consequently, there is a need for a rapid and consistent genomic annotation tool dedicated for bacteriophages. Existing tools either are not designed specifically for bacteriophages or are web- and email-based and require significant manual curation, which makes their integration into bioinformatic pipelines challenging. Pharokka was created to provide a tool that annotates bacteriophage genomes easily, rapidly and consistently with standards compliant outputs. Moreover, Pharokka requires only two lines of code to install and use and takes under 5 min to run for an average 50-kb bacteriophage genome. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Pharokka is implemented in Python and is available as a bioconda package using 'conda install -c bioconda pharokka'. The source code is available on GitHub (https://github.com/gbouras13/pharokka). Pharokka has been tested on Linux-64 and MacOSX machines and on Windows using a Linux Virtual Machine.","date":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","citationCount":0,"authors":[{"name":"Bouras G."},{"name":"Nepal R."},{"name":"Houtak G."},{"name":"Psaltis A.J."},{"name":"Wormald P.-J."},{"name":"Vreugde S."}],"journal":"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)"}}],"credit":[{"name":"George Bouras","email":"george.bouras@adelaide.edu.au","url":null,"orcidid":"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5885-4186","gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":[],"note":null},{"name":"Sarah Vreugde","email":null,"url":null,"orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":null,"typeRole":[],"note":null},{"name":"Peter-John Wormald","email":null,"url":null,"orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":null,"typeRole":[],"note":null},{"name":"Roshan Nepal","email":null,"url":null,"orcidid":"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5469-3397","gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":null,"typeRole":[],"note":null}],"community":null,"owner":"Jennifer","additionDate":"2023-02-15T12:31:17.004078Z","lastUpdate":"2023-11-02T09:06:37.416955Z","editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["ELIXIR-CZ"]},"validated":0,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":"tool"}
