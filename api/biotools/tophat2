In this paper, we describe TopHat2, which incorporates many significant enhancements to TopHat. TopHat2 can align reads of various lengths produced by the latest sequencing technologies, while allowing for variable-length indels with respect to the reference genome. In addition to de novo spliced alignment, TopHat2 can align reads across fusion breaks, which can occur after genomic translocations. TopHat2 combines the ability to identify novel splice sites with direct mapping to known transcripts, producing sensitive and accurate alignments, even for highly repetitive genomes or in the presence of pseudogenes.

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.High-throughput data production technologies, particularly 'next-generation' DNA sequencing, have ushered in widespread and disruptive changes to biomedical research. Making sense of the large datasets produced by these technologies requires sophisticated statistical and computational methods, as well as substantial computational power. This has led to an acute crisis in life sciences, as researchers without informatics training attempt to perform computation-dependent analyses. Since 2005, the Galaxy project has worked to address this problem by providing a framework that makes advanced computational tools usable by non experts. Galaxy seeks to make data-intensive research more accessible, transparent and reproducible by providing a Web-based environment in which users can perform computational analyses and have all of the details automatically tracked for later inspection, publication, or reuse. In this report we highlight recently added features enabling biomedical analyses on a large scale.","date":"2016-07-08T00:00:00Z","citationCount":1031,"authors":[{"name":"Afgan E."},{"name":"Baker D."},{"name":"van den Beek M."},{"name":"Blankenberg D."},{"name":"Bouvier D."},{"name":"Cech M."},{"name":"Chilton J."},{"name":"Clements D."},{"name":"Coraor N."},{"name":"Eberhard C."},{"name":"Gruning B."},{"name":"Guerler A."},{"name":"Hillman-Jackson J."},{"name":"Von Kuster G."},{"name":"Rasche E."},{"name":"Soranzo N."},{"name":"Turaga N."},{"name":"Taylor J."},{"name":"Nekrutenko A."},{"name":"Goecks J."}],"journal":"Nucleic acids research"}},{"doi":"10.7490/f1000research.1114334.1","pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"type":["Other"],"version":null,"note":null,"metadata":null},{"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btp120","pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"type":["Primary"],"version":null,"note":null,"metadata":{"title":"TopHat: Discovering splice junctions with RNA-Seq","abstract":"Motivation: A new protocol for sequencing the messenger RNA in a cell, known as RNA-Seq, generates millions of short sequence fragments in a single run. These fragments, or 'reads', can be used to measure levels of gene expression and to identify novel splice variants of genes. However, current software for aligning RNA-Seq data to a genome relies on known splice junctions and cannot identify novel ones. TopHat is an efficient read-mapping algorithm designed to align reads from an RNA-Seq experiment to a reference genome without relying on known splice sites. Results: We mapped the RNA-Seq reads from a recent mammalian RNA-Seq experiment and recovered more than 72% of the splice junctions reported by the annotation-based software from that study, along with nearly 20 000 previously unreported junctions. The TopHat pipeline is much faster than previous systems, mapping nearly 2.2 million reads per CPU hour, which is sufficient to process an entire RNA-Seq experiment in less than a day on a standard desktop computer. We describe several challenges unique to ab initio splice site discovery from RNA-Seq reads that will require further algorithm development. © 2009 The Author(s).","date":"2009-05-07T00:00:00Z","citationCount":8225,"authors":[{"name":"Trapnell C."},{"name":"Pachter L."},{"name":"Salzberg S.L."}],"journal":"Bioinformatics"}}],"credit":[{"name":"Galaxy Support Team","email":"galaxy@pasteur.fr","url":null,"orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Primary contact"],"note":null},{"name":"Top Hat team","email":"tophat.cufflinks@gmail.com","url":null,"orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":null,"typeRole":[],"note":"Please do not email technical questions to TopHat contributors directly."},{"name":"Cole Trapnell","email":null,"url":"http://www.cs.umd.edu/~cole/","orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Contributor"],"note":null},{"name":"Daehwan Kim","email":null,"url":"http://kim-lab.org/","orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Contributor"],"note":null},{"name":"Geo Pertea","email":null,"url":null,"orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Contributor"],"note":null},{"name":"Harold Pimentel","email":null,"url":"http://cs.berkeley.edu/~pimentel","orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Contributor"],"note":null},{"name":"Ryan Kelley","email":null,"url":null,"orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Contributor"],"note":null},{"name":"Lior Pachter","email":null,"url":"http://www.math.berkeley.edu/~lpachter/","orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Contributor"],"note":null},{"name":"Steven Salzberg","email":null,"url":"http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/~salzberg/","orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Contributor"],"note":null}],"community":null,"owner":"hmenager","additionDate":"2016-12-19T14:23:03Z","lastUpdate":"2020-06-16T10:55:21Z","editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"validated":1,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":null}
