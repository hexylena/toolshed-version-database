Compared with web-interface-based related tools, PACKMOL-Memgen allows setup of multiple configurations of a system in a user-friendly and efficient manner within minutes. The generated systems are well-packed and thus well-suited as starting configurations in MD simulations under periodic boundary conditions, requiring only moderate equilibration times. PACKMOL-Memgen is distributed with AmberTools and runs on most computing platforms, and its output can also be used for CHARMM or adapted to other molecular-simulation packages.","date":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","citationCount":28,"authors":[{"name":"Schott-Verdugo S."},{"name":"Gohlke H."}],"journal":"Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling"}}],"credit":[{"name":null,"email":"amber@ambermd.org","url":null,"orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Primary contact"],"note":null}],"community":null,"owner":"hans","additionDate":"2019-08-09T13:16:25Z","lastUpdate":"2020-06-16T10:55:26Z","editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"validated":1,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":null}
