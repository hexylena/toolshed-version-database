Owing to these limitations, central ecological questions with respect to the global distribution of microbes and the functional diversity of their communities cannot be robustly assessed.Results: We introduce Nonpareil, a method to estimate and project coverage in metagenomes. Nonpareil does not rely on high-quality assemblies, operational taxonomic unit calling or comprehensive reference databases; thus, it is broadly applicable to metagenomic studies. Application of Nonpareil on available metagenomic datasets provided estimates on the relative complexity of soil, freshwater and human microbiome communities, and suggested that ∼200 Gb of sequencing data are required for 95% abundance-weighted average coverage of the soil communities analyzed. © 2013 The Author 2013.
