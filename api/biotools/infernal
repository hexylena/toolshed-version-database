{"name":"Infernal","description":"Infernal (\"INFERence of RNA ALignment\") is for searching DNA sequence databases for RNA structure and sequence similarities. It is an implementation of a special case of profile stochastic context-free grammars called covariance models (CMs). A CM is like a sequence profile, but it scores a combination of sequence consensus and RNA secondary structure consensus, so in many cases, it is more capable of identifying RNA homologs that conserve their secondary structure more than their primary sequence.","homepage":"http://eddylab.org/infernal/","biotoolsID":"infernal","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:infernal","version":[],"otherID":[],"relation":[],"function":[{"operation":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0415","term":"Nucleic acid feature detection"}],"input":[{"data":{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_1354","term":"Sequence profile"},"format":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2069","term":"Sequence profile format"}]}],"output":[{"data":{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_2080","term":"Database search results"},"format":[]}],"note":null,"cmd":null}],"toolType":["Command-line tool"],"topic":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0160","term":"Sequence sites, features and motifs"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0122","term":"Structural genomics"}],"operatingSystem":[],"language":["C"],"license":"BSD-3-Clause","collectionID":[],"maturity":null,"cost":null,"accessibility":null,"elixirPlatform":[],"elixirNode":[],"elixirCommunity":[],"link":[{"url":"https://github.com/EddyRivasLab/infernal","type":["Repository"],"note":null}],"download":[],"documentation":[],"publication":[{"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btt509","pmid":"24008419","pmcid":"PMC3810854","type":["Primary"],"version":null,"note":null,"metadata":{"title":"Infernal 1.1: 100-fold faster RNA homology searches","abstract":"Summary: Infernal builds probabilistic profiles of the sequence and secondary structure of an RNA family called covariance models (CMs) from structurally annotated multiple sequence alignments given as input. Infernal uses CMs to search for new family members in sequence databases and to create potentially large multiple sequence alignments. Version 1.1 of Infernal introduces a new filter pipeline for RNA homology search based on accelerated profile hidden Markov model (HMM) methods and HMM-banded CM alignment methods. This enables ∼100-fold acceleration over the previous version and ∼10 000-fold acceleration over exhaustive non-filtered CM searches. © The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press.
