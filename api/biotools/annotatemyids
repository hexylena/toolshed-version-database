{"name":"annotatemyids","description":"This tool can get annotation for a generic set of IDs, using the Bioconductor annotation data packages. Supported organisms are human, mouse, rat, fruit fly and zebrafish. The org.db packages that are used here are primarily based on mapping using Entrez Gene identifiers. More information on the annotation packages can be found at the Bioconductor website, for example, information on the human annotation package (org.Hs.eg.db) can be found here.","homepage":"https://usegalaxy.org.au/root?tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu%2Frepos%2Fiuc%2Fannotatemyids%2Fannotatemyids%2F3.12.0%2Bgalaxy1","biotoolsID":"annotatemyids","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:annotatemyids","version":[],"otherID":[],"relation":[],"function":[{"operation":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0226","term":"Annotation"}],"input":[],"output":[],"note":null,"cmd":null}],"toolType":["Web application"],"topic":[],"operatingSystem":["Mac","Linux","Windows"],"language":["R"],"license":"MIT","collectionID":[],"maturity":null,"cost":"Free of charge","accessibility":"Open access","elixirPlatform":[],"elixirNode":[],"elixirCommunity":[],"link":[{"url":"https://github.com/markdunning/galaxy-annotateMyIDs","type":["Repository"],"note":null}],"download":[],"documentation":[],"publication":[],"credit":[],"community":null,"owner":"Jennifer","additionDate":"2022-04-17T09:49:35.946675Z","lastUpdate":"2022-06-28T13:42:55.613820Z","editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["llamothe"]},"validated":1,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":"tool"}
