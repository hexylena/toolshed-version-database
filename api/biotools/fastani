{"name":"FastANI","description":"FastANI is developed for fast alignment-free computation of whole-genome Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI). ANI is defined as mean nucleotide identity of orthologous gene pairs shared between two microbial genomes. FastANI supports pairwise comparison of both complete and draft genome assemblies.","homepage":"https://github.com/ParBLiSS/FastANI","biotoolsID":"fastani","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:fastani","version":[],"otherID":[],"relation":[],"function":[{"operation":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3182","term":"Genome alignment"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0346","term":"Sequence similarity search"}],"input":[],"output":[],"note":null,"cmd":null}],"toolType":["Command-line tool"],"topic":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3301","term":"Microbiology"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0199","term":"Genetic variation"}],"operatingSystem":["Mac","Linux"],"language":["C++"],"license":"Apache-2.0","collectionID":[],"maturity":null,"cost":"Free of charge","accessibility":"Open access","elixirPlatform":[],"elixirNode":[],"elixirCommunity":[],"link":[{"url":"https://github.com/ParBLiSS/FastANI/issues","type":["Issue tracker"],"note":null}],"download":[],"documentation":[],"publication":[],"credit":[{"name":"Parallel and Sequential Bioinformatics Libraries for High Throughput Sequences","email":null,"url":"https://github.com/ParBLiSS","orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Project","typeRole":["Primary contact"],"note":null}],"community":null,"owner":"Kigaard","additionDate":"2022-03-21T08:31:18.150360Z","lastUpdate":"2022-12-07T10:15:47.894637Z","editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["alexcorm"]},"validated":0,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":"tool"}
