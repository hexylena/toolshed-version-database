{"name":"pathview","description":"Tool set for pathway based data integration and visualization that maps and renders a wide variety of biological data on relevant pathway graphs. It downloads the pathway graph data, parses the data file, maps user data to the pathway, and render pathway graph with the mapped data. In addition, it integrates with pathway and gene set (enrichment) analysis tools for large-scale and fully automated analysis.","homepage":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/pathview.html","biotoolsID":"pathview","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:pathview","version":["1.14.0"],"otherID":[],"relation":[],"function":[{"operation":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2497","term":"Pathway or network analysis"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3083","term":"Pathway or network visualisation"}],"input":[],"output":[],"note":null,"cmd":null}],"toolType":["Command-line tool","Library"],"topic":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0602","term":"Molecular interactions, pathways and networks"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_2259","term":"Systems biology"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0092","term":"Data visualisation"}],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"language":["R"],"license":"GPL-3.0","collectionID":["Pathview","BioConductor"],"maturity":null,"cost":null,"accessibility":null,"elixirPlatform":[],"elixirNode":[],"elixirCommunity":[],"link":[{"url":"http://pathview.uncc.edu/","type":["Mirror"],"note":null}],"download":[{"url":"http://bioconductor/packages/release/bioc/src/contrib/pathview_1.14.0.tar.gz","type":"Source code","note":null,"version":null}],"documentation":[{"url":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/pathview.html","type":["User manual"],"note":null}],"publication":[{"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btt285","pmid":"23740750","pmcid":"PMC3702256","type":["Primary"],"version":null,"note":null,"metadata":{"title":"Pathview: An R/Bioconductor package for pathway-based data integration and visualization","abstract":"Pathview is a novel tool set for pathway-based data integration and visualization. It maps and renders user data on relevant pathway graphs. Users only need to supply their data and specify the target pathway. Pathview automatically downloads the pathway graph data, parses the data file, maps and integrates user data onto the pathway and renders pathway graphs with the mapped data. Although built as a stand-alone program, Pathview may seamlessly integrate with pathway and functional analysis tools for large-scale and fully automated analysis pipelines. Â© 2013 The Author 2013.
