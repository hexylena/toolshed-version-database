Typical demands include querying taxonomy identifier (TaxIds) by taxonomy names, querying complete taxonomic lineages by TaxIds, listing descendants of given TaxIds, and others. However, existed tools are either limited in functionalities or inefficient in terms of runtime. In this work, we present TaxonKit, a command-line toolkit for comprehensive and efficient manipulation of NCBI Taxonomy data. TaxonKit comprises seven core subcommands providing functions, including TaxIds querying, listing, filtering, lineage retrieving and reformatting, lowest common ancestor computation, and TaxIds change tracking. The practical functions, competitive processing performance, scalability with different scales of datasets and good accessibility can facilitate taxonomy data manipulations. TaxonKit provides free access under the permissive MIT license on GitHub, Brewsci, and Bioconda.
