Currently, users can access information from more than 62 distinct datasets covering some 400 million entries. The data resources represented in the EB-eye include: nucleotide and protein sequences at both the genomic and proteomic levels, structures ranging from chemicals to macro-molecular complexes, gene-expression experiments, binary level molecular interactions as well as reaction maps and pathway models, functional classifications, biological ontologies, and comprehensive literature libraries covering the biomedical sciences and related intellectual property. The EB-eye can be accessed over the web or programmatically using a SOAP Web Services interface. This allows its search and retrieval capabilities to be exploited in workflows and analytical pipe-lines. The EB-eye is a novel alternative to existing biological search and retrieval engines. In this article we describe in detail how to exploit its powerful capabilities. © The Author 2010.

Access to these services is provided via user-friendly web interfaces and via established RESTful and SOAP Web Services APIs (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/seqdb/confluence/display/JDSAT/EMBL-EBI+Web+Services+APIs+-+Data+Retrieval). Both systems have been developed with the same core principles that allow them to integrate an ever-increasing volume of biological data, making them an integral part of many popular data resources provided at the EMBL-EBI.
