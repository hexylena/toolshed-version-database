After the pseudomolecules are constructed, RaGOO identifies structural variants, including those spanning sequencing gaps. We show that RaGOO accurately orders and orients 3 de novo tomato genome assemblies, including the widely used M82 reference cultivar. We then demonstrate the scalability and utility of RaGOO with a pan-genome analysis of 103 Arabidopsis thaliana accessions by examining the structural variants detected in the newly assembled pseudomolecules. RaGOO is available open source at https://github.com/malonge/RaGOO.","date":"2019-10-28T00:00:00Z","citationCount":84,"authors":[{"name":"Alonge M."},{"name":"Soyk S."},{"name":"Ramakrishnan S."},{"name":"Wang X."},{"name":"Goodwin S."},{"name":"Sedlazeck F.J."},{"name":"Lippman Z.B."},{"name":"Schatz M.C."}],"journal":"Genome Biology"}}],"credit":[],"community":null,"owner":"gallardoalba","additionDate":"2021-09-29T11:54:49.788318Z","lastUpdate":"2021-09-29T11:54:49.791598Z","editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"validated":0,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":null}
