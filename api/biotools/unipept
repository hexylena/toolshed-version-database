Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.Summary Unipept is an open source web application that is designed for metaproteomics analysis with a focus on interactive datavisualization. It is underpinned by a fast index built from UniProtKB and the NCBI taxonomy that enables quick retrieval of all UniProt entries in which a given tryptic peptide occurs. Unipept version 2.4 introduced web services that provide programmatic access to the metaproteomics analysis features. This enables integration of Unipept functionality in custom applications and data processing pipelines. Availability and implementation: The web services are freely available at http://api.unipept.ugent.be and are open sourced under the MIT license. Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","date":"2016-06-01T00:00:00Z","citationCount":32,"authors":[{"name":"Mesuere B."},{"name":"Willems T."},{"name":"Van Der Jeugt F."},{"name":"Devreese B."},{"name":"Vandamme P."},{"name":"Dawyndt P."}],"journal":"Bioinformatics"}},{"doi":"10.1021/ACS.JPROTEOME.0C00855","pmid":"33401902","pmcid":null,"type":[],"version":null,"note":null,"metadata":{"title":"Unipept Desktop: A Faster, More Powerful Metaproteomics Results Analysis Tool","abstract":"© 2021 American Chemical Society.Metaproteomics has become an important research tool to study microbial systems, which has resulted in increased metaproteomics data generation. However, efficient tools for processing the acquired data have lagged behind. One widely used tool for metaproteomics data interpretation is Unipept, a web-based tool that provides, among others, interactive and insightful visualizations. Due to its web-based implementation, however, the Unipept web application is limited in the amount of data that can be analyzed. In this manuscript we therefore present Unipept Desktop, a desktop application version of Unipept that is designed to drastically increase the throughput and capacity of metaproteomics data analysis. Moreover, it provides a novel comparative analysis pipeline and improves the organization of experimental data into projects, thus addressing the growing need for more efficient and versatile analysis tools for metaproteomics data.","date":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","citationCount":0,"authors":[{"name":"Verschaffelt P."},{"name":"Van Den Bossche T."},{"name":"Martens L."},{"name":"Dawyndt P."},{"name":"Mesuere B."}],"journal":"Journal of Proteome Research"}}],"credit":[{"name":"ugent.be","email":null,"url":null,"orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Institute","typeRole":["Provider"],"note":null},{"name":null,"email":"Unipept@ugent.be","url":null,"orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Primary contact"],"note":null}],"community":null,"owner":"bmesuere","additionDate":"2016-05-17T10:18:37Z","lastUpdate":"2021-05-27T07:31:15Z","editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"validated":1,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":null}
