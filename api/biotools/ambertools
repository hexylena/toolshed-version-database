{"name":"AmberTools","description":"Consists of several independently developed packages that work well by themselves, and with Amber (Assisted Model Building with Energy Refinement) itself. The suite can also be used to carry out complete (non-periodic) molecular dynamics simulations (using NAB), with generalized Born solvent models.","homepage":"http://ambermd.org/#AmberTools","biotoolsID":"ambertools","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:ambertools","version":[],"otherID":[],"relation":[],"function":[{"operation":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2476","term":"Molecular dynamics simulation"}],"input":[],"output":[],"note":null,"cmd":null}],"toolType":["Suite"],"topic":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_2275","term":"Molecular modelling"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0176","term":"Molecular dynamics"}],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"language":["C++","Fortran","C"],"license":null,"collectionID":[],"maturity":null,"cost":null,"accessibility":null,"elixirPlatform":[],"elixirNode":[],"elixirCommunity":[],"link":[{"url":"http://www.mybiosoftware.com/ambertools-1-4-molecular-dynamics-simulation.html","type":["Software catalogue"],"note":null}],"download":[],"documentation":[{"url":"http://ambermd.org/doc12/","type":["General"],"note":null}],"publication":[{"doi":null,"pmid":"16200636","pmcid":null,"type":[],"version":null,"note":null,"metadata":{"title":"The Amber biomolecular simulation programs","abstract":"We describe the development, current features, and some directions for future development of the Amber package of computer programs.
