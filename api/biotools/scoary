{"name":"Scoary","description":"Pan-genome wide association studies and  is designed to take the gene_presence_absence.csv file from Roary as well as a traits file created by the user and calculate the assocations between all genes in the accessory genome (all genes that are present in i genomes where 1 < i < N) and the traits. It reports a list of genes sorted by strength of association per trait.","homepage":"https://github.com/AdmiralenOla/Scoary","biotoolsID":"scoary","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:scoary","version":["1.6.11"],"otherID":[],"relation":[],"function":[{"operation":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2945","term":"Analysis"}],"input":[{"data":{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0916","term":"Gene report"},"format":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2330","term":"Textual format"}]}],"output":[{"data":{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_1669","term":"P-value"},"format":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3752","term":"CSV"}]}],"note":"Scoary correlates the genes of an accessory genome to an observed phenotype (e.g. resistance towards a certain antibiotic compound, a particular pathotype etc.).

Here we introduce Scoary, an ultra-fast, easy-to-use, and widely applicable software tool that scores the components of the pan-genome for associations to observed phenotypic traits while accounting for population stratification, with minimal assumptions about evolutionary processes. We call our approach pan-GWAS to distinguish it from traditional, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based GWAS.
