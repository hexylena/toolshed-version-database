Published by Oxford University Press.Summary: MEGAHIT is a NGS de novo assembler for assembling large and complex metagenomics data in a time- and cost-efficient manner. It finished assembling a soil metagenomics dataset with 252∈Gbps in 44.1 and 99.6∈h on a single computing node with and without a graphics processing unit, respectively. MEGAHIT assembles the data as a whole, i.e. no pre-processing like partitioning and normalization was needed. When compared with previous methods on assembling the soil data, MEGAHIT generated a three-time larger assembly, with longer contig N50 and average contig length; furthermore, 55.8% of the reads were aligned to the assembly, giving a fourfold improvement.","date":"2015-05-15T00:00:00Z","citationCount":1103,"authors":[{"name":"Li D."},{"name":"Liu C.-M."},{"name":"Luo R."},{"name":"Sadakane K."},{"name":"Lam T.-W."}],"journal":"Bioinformatics"}}],"credit":[{"name":"L3 Bioinformatics Limited","email":"rb@l3-bioinfo.com","url":"https://github.com/voutcn","orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Primary contact"],"note":null}],"community":null,"owner":"mbs_import","additionDate":"2017-08-03T18:49:14Z","lastUpdate":"2023-11-02T09:05:14.074610Z","editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["ELIXIR-CZ"]},"validated":1,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":null}
