Published by Oxford University Press.Motivation: Ribosomal RNA profiling has become crucial to studying microbial communities, but meaningful taxonomic analysis and inter-comparison of such data are still hampered by technical limitations, between-study design variability and inconsistencies between taxonomies used. Results: Here we present MAPseq, a framework for reference-based rRNA sequence analysis that is up to 30% more accurate (F1=2 score) and up to one hundred times faster than existing solutions, providing in a single run multiple taxonomy classifications and hierarchical operational taxonomic unit mappings, for rRNA sequences in both amplicon and shotgun sequencing strategies, and for datasets of virtually any size.","date":"2017-12-01T00:00:00Z","citationCount":30,"authors":[{"name":"Matias Rodrigues J.F."},{"name":"Schmidt T.S.B."},{"name":"Tackmann J."},{"name":"Von Mering C."}],"journal":"Bioinformatics"}}],"credit":[{"name":"Christian von Mering","email":"mering@imls.uzh.ch","url":null,"orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Primary contact"],"note":null}],"community":null,"owner":"d.gabrielaitis","additionDate":"2018-06-17T18:22:11Z","lastUpdate":"2018-12-10T12:58:59Z","editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"validated":1,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":null}
