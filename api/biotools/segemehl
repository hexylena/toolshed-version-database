{"name":"segemehl","description":"A software to map short sequencer reads to reference genomes. Unlike other methods, segemehl is able to detect not only mismatches but also insertions and deletions. Furthermore, this tool is not limited to a specific read length and is able to map primer- or polyadenylation contaminated reads correctly.","homepage":"http://hoffmann.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/LIFE/segemehl.html","biotoolsID":"segemehl","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:segemehl","version":[],"otherID":[],"relation":[],"function":[{"operation":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2520","term":"DNA mapping"}],"input":[],"output":[],"note":null,"cmd":null}],"toolType":["Command-line tool"],"topic":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0654","term":"DNA"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0102","term":"Mapping"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3168","term":"Sequencing"}],"operatingSystem":["Linux"],"language":["C"],"license":null,"collectionID":[],"maturity":null,"cost":null,"accessibility":null,"elixirPlatform":[],"elixirNode":[],"elixirCommunity":[],"link":[{"url":"http://www.mybiosoftware.com/segemehl-0-1-fast-short-read-mapping-indels.html","type":["Software catalogue"],"note":null}],"download":[],"documentation":[{"url":"http://hoffmann.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/LIFE/segemehl.html","type":["General"],"note":null}],"publication":[{"doi":null,"pmid":"24626854","pmcid":null,"type":[],"version":null,"note":null,"metadata":{"title":"Lacking alignments? The next-generation sequencing mapper segemehl revisited","abstract":"Motivation: Next-generation sequencing has become an important tool in molecular biology. Various protocols to investigate genomic, transcriptomic and epigenomic features across virtually all species and tissues have been devised. For most of these experiments, one of the first crucial steps of bioinformatic analysis is the mapping of reads to reference genomes. Results: Here, we present thorough benchmarks of our read aligner segemehl in comparison with other state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we introduce the tool lack to rescue unmapped RNA-seq reads which works in conjunction with segemehl and many other frequently used split-read aligners.
