Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.With increased generation of high-resolution sequence-based ?Omics? data, detecting statistically significant effects at different genomic locations and scales has become key to addressing several scientific questions. IWTomics is an R/Bioconductor package (integrated in Galaxy) that, exploiting sophisticated Functional Data Analysis techniques (i.e. statistical techniques that deal with the analysis of curves), allows users to pre-process, visualize and test these data at multiple locations and scales. The package provides a friendly, flexible and complete workflow that can be employed in many genomic and epigenomic applications.","date":"2018-07-01T00:00:00Z","citationCount":5,"authors":[{"name":"Cremona M.A."},{"name":"Pini A."},{"name":"Cumbo F."},{"name":"Makova K.D."},{"name":"Chiaromonte F."},{"name":"Vantini S."}],"journal":"Bioinformatics"}}],"credit":[{"name":"Marzia A Cremona","email":"mac78@psu.edu","url":null,"orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Primary contact"],"note":null}],"community":null,"owner":"shadi.m","additionDate":"2018-07-10T10:12:32Z","lastUpdate":"2018-12-10T12:59:00Z","editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"validated":1,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":null}
