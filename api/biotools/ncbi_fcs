{"name":"NCBI fcs","description":"The NCBI Foreign Contamination Screen (FCS) is a tool suite for identifying and removing contaminant sequences in genome assemblies. Contaminants are defined as sequences in a dataset that do not originate from the biological source organism and can arise from a variety of environmental and laboratory sources. FCS will help you remove contaminants from genomes before submission to GenBank.","homepage":"https://github.com/ncbi/fcs","biotoolsID":"ncbi_fcs","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:ncbi_fcs","version":["0.2.2"],"otherID":[],"relation":[],"function":[{"operation":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3180","term":"Sequence assembly validation"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3192","term":"Sequence trimming"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3187","term":"Sequence contamination filtering"}],"input":[],"output":[],"note":null,"cmd":null}],"toolType":["Command-line tool"],"topic":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0080","term":"Sequence analysis"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0196","term":"Sequence assembly"}],"operatingSystem":[],"language":[],"license":null,"collectionID":[],"maturity":null,"cost":null,"accessibility":null,"elixirPlatform":[],"elixirNode":[],"elixirCommunity":[],"link":[],"download":[],"documentation":[],"publication":[],"credit":[],"community":null,"owner":"alexcorm","additionDate":"2022-09-28T12:31:12.305103Z","lastUpdate":"2022-09-28T12:31:12.307787Z","editPermission":{"type":"public","authors":[]},"validated":0,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":null}
