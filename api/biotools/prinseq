{"name":"PRINSEQ","description":"PRINSEQ is a sequence processing tool that can be used to filter, reformat and trim genomic and metagenomic sequence data. It generates summary statistics of the input in graphical and tabular formats that can be used for quality control steps. PRINSEQ is available as both standalone and web-based versions.","homepage":"http://edwards.sdsu.edu/prinseq","biotoolsID":"prinseq","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:prinseq","version":[],"otherID":[],"relation":[],"function":[{"operation":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3219","term":"Read pre-processing"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3192","term":"Sequence trimming"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3187","term":"Sequence contamination filtering"}],"input":[],"output":[],"note":null,"cmd":null}],"toolType":["Web application"],"topic":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3308","term":"Transcriptomics"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3174","term":"Metagenomics"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0622","term":"Genomics"}],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"language":["Perl"],"license":"GPL-3.0","collectionID":["Animal and Crop Genomics"],"maturity":"Mature","cost":null,"accessibility":null,"elixirPlatform":[],"elixirNode":[],"elixirCommunity":[],"link":[],"download":[],"documentation":[{"url":"http://prinseq.sourceforge.net/faq.html","type":["General"],"note":null}],"publication":[{"doi":null,"pmid":"21278185","pmcid":null,"type":[],"version":null,"note":null,"metadata":{"title":"Quality control and preprocessing of metagenomic datasets","abstract":"Summary: Here, we present PRINSEQ for easy and rapid quality control and data preprocessing of genomic and metagenomic datasets.
