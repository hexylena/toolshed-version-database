Current molecular tests examine limited numbers of mutations, and although whole genome sequencing approaches could fully characterise DR, data complexity has restricted their clinical application. A library (1,325 mutations) predictive of DR for 15 anti-tuberculosis drugs was compiled and validated for 11 of them using genomic-phenotypic data from 792 strains. A rapid online 'TB-Profiler' tool was developed to report DR and strain-type profiles directly from raw sequences. Using our DR mutation library, in silico diagnostic accuracy was superior to some commercial diagnostics and alternative databases. The library will facilitate sequence-based drug-susceptibility testing.","date":"2015-12-14T00:00:00Z","citationCount":218,"authors":[{"name":"Coll F."},{"name":"McNerney R."},{"name":"Preston M.D."},{"name":"Guerra-Assuncao J.A."},{"name":"Warry A."},{"name":"Hill-Cawthorne G."},{"name":"Mallard K."},{"name":"Nair M."},{"name":"Miranda A."},{"name":"Alves A."},{"name":"Perdigao J."},{"name":"Viveiros M."},{"name":"Portugal I."},{"name":"Hasan Z."},{"name":"Hasan R."},{"name":"Glynn J.R."},{"name":"Martin N."},{"name":"Pain A."},{"name":"Clark T.G."}],"journal":"Genome Medicine"}}],"credit":[{"name":"Jody Phelan","email":"jody.phelan@lshtm.ac.uk","url":"https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/phelan.jody","orcidid":"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8323-7019","gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":null,"typeRole":[],"note":null}],"community":null,"owner":"pvanheus","additionDate":"2022-05-30T13:42:55.076368Z","lastUpdate":"2022-05-30T13:42:55.162148Z","editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"validated":0,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":null}
