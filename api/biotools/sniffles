Single-molecule long-read sequencing has the potential to dramatically advance the field, although high error rates are a challenge with existing methods. Addressing this need, we introduce open-source methods for long-read alignment (NGMLR; https://github.com/philres/ngmlr) and structural variant identification (Sniffles; https://github.com/fritzsedlazeck/Sniffles) that provide unprecedented sensitivity and precision for variant detection, even in repeat-rich regions and for complex nested events that can have substantial effects on human health. In several long-read datasets, including healthy and cancerous human genomes, we discovered thousands of novel variants and categorized systematic errors in short-read approaches. NGMLR and Sniffles can automatically filter false events and operate on low-coverage data, thereby reducing the high costs that have hindered the application of long reads in clinical and research settings.","date":"2018-06-01T00:00:00Z","citationCount":297,"authors":[{"name":"Sedlazeck F.J."},{"name":"Rescheneder P."},{"name":"Smolka M."},{"name":"Fang H."},{"name":"Nattestad M."},{"name":"Von Haeseler A."},{"name":"Schatz M.C."}],"journal":"Nature Methods"}}],"credit":[{"name":"Fritz J Sedlazeck","email":"fritz.sedlazeck@gmail.com","url":null,"orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Primary contact"],"note":null}],"community":null,"owner":"ELIXIR-EE","additionDate":"2018-05-15T15:47:56Z","lastUpdate":"2021-05-16T15:30:22Z","editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"validated":1,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":null}
