Stable computational methods to perform primary tasks such as quality control, read mapping, peak calling, and counting are likewise available. However, there is a lack of uniform standards for graphical data mining, which is also of central importance. To fill this gap, we developed SeqCode, an open suite of applications that analyzes sequencing data in an elegant but efficient manner. Our software is a portable resource written in ANSI C that can be expected to work for almost all genomes in any computational configuration. Furthermore, we offer a user-friendly front-end web server that integrates SeqCode functions with other graphical analysis tools. Our analysis and visualization toolkit represents a significant improvement in terms of performance and usability as compare to other existing programs. Thus, SeqCode has the potential to become a key multipurpose instrument for high-throughput professional analysis; further, it provides an extremely useful open educational platform for the world-wide scientific community.
