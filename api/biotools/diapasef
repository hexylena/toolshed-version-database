Although these selection windows collectively cover the entire m/z range, overall, only a few per cent of all incoming ions are isolated for mass analysis. Here, we make use of the correlation of molecular weight and ion mobility in a trapped ion mobility device (timsTOF Pro) to devise a scan mode that samples up to 100% of the peptide precursor ion current in m/z and mobility windows. We extend an established targeted data extraction workflow by inclusion of the ion mobility dimension for both signal extraction and scoring and thereby increase the specificity for precursor identification. Data acquired from whole proteome digests and mixed organism samples demonstrate deep proteome coverage and a high degree of reproducibility as well as quantitative accuracy, even from 10 ng sample amounts.","date":"2020-12-01T00:00:00Z","citationCount":24,"authors":[{"name":"Meier F."},{"name":"Brunner A.-D."},{"name":"Frank M."},{"name":"Ha A."},{"name":"Bludau I."},{"name":"Voytik E."},{"name":"Kaspar-Schoenefeld S."},{"name":"Lubeck M."},{"name":"Raether O."},{"name":"Bache N."},{"name":"Aebersold R."},{"name":"Collins B.C."},{"name":"Rost H.L."},{"name":"Mann M."}],"journal":"Nature Methods"}}],"credit":[{"name":"Ben C.
