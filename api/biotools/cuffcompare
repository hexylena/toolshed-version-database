However, this would require algorithms that are not restricted by prior gene annotations and that account for alternative transcription and splicing. Here we introduce such algorithms in an open-source software program called Cufflinks. To test Cufflinks, we sequenced and analyzed <430 million paired 75-bp RNA-Seq reads from a mouse myoblast cell line over a differentiation time series. We detected 13,692 known transcripts and 3,724 previously unannotated ones, 62% of which are supported by independent expression data or by homologous genes in other species. Over the time series, 330 genes showed complete switches in the dominant transcription start site (TSS) or splice isoform, and we observed more subtle shifts in 1,304 other genes. These results suggest that Cufflinks can illuminate the substantial regulatory flexibility and complexity in even this well-studied model of muscle development and that it can improve transcriptome-based genome annotation. © 2010 Nature America, Inc.

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.High-throughput data production technologies, particularly 'next-generation' DNA sequencing, have ushered in widespread and disruptive changes to biomedical research. Making sense of the large datasets produced by these technologies requires sophisticated statistical and computational methods, as well as substantial computational power. This has led to an acute crisis in life sciences, as researchers without informatics training attempt to perform computation-dependent analyses. Since 2005, the Galaxy project has worked to address this problem by providing a framework that makes advanced computational tools usable by non experts. Galaxy seeks to make data-intensive research more accessible, transparent and reproducible by providing a Web-based environment in which users can perform computational analyses and have all of the details automatically tracked for later inspection, publication, or reuse. In this report we highlight recently added features enabling biomedical analyses on a large scale.","date":"2016-07-08T00:00:00Z","citationCount":1025,"authors":[{"name":"Afgan E."},{"name":"Baker D."},{"name":"van den Beek M."},{"name":"Blankenberg D."},{"name":"Bouvier D."},{"name":"Cech M."},{"name":"Chilton J."},{"name":"Clements D."},{"name":"Coraor N."},{"name":"Eberhard C."},{"name":"Gruning B."},{"name":"Guerler A."},{"name":"Hillman-Jackson J."},{"name":"Von Kuster G."},{"name":"Rasche E."},{"name":"Soranzo N."},{"name":"Turaga N."},{"name":"Taylor J."},{"name":"Nekrutenko A."},{"name":"Goecks J."}],"journal":"Nucleic acids research"}},{"doi":"10.7490/f1000research.1114334.1","pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"type":["Other"],"version":null,"note":null,"metadata":null}],"credit":[{"name":"Galaxy Support Team","email":"galaxy@pasteur.fr","url":null,"orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Primary contact"],"note":null}],"community":null,"owner":"hmenager","additionDate":"2016-12-19T14:29:34Z","lastUpdate":"2020-06-16T10:55:20Z","editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"validated":1,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":null}
