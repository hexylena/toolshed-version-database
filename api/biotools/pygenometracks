Published by Oxford University Press.MOTIVATION: Generating publication ready plots to display multiple genomic tracks can pose a serious challenge. Making desirable and accurate figures requires considerable effort. This is usually done by hand or using a vector graphic software. RESULTS: pyGenomeTracks (PGT) is a modular plotting tool that easily combines multiple tracks. It enables a reproducible and standardized generation of highly customizable and publication ready images. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: PGT is available through a graphical interface on https://usegalaxy.eu and through the command line. It is provided on conda via the bioconda channel, on pip and it is openly developed on github: https://github.com/deeptools/pyGenomeTracks. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","date":"2021-04-20T00:00:00Z","citationCount":7,"authors":[{"name":"Lopez-Delisle L."},{"name":"Rabbani L."},{"name":"Wolff J."},{"name":"Bhardwaj V."},{"name":"Backofen R."},{"name":"Gruning B."},{"name":"Ramirez F."},{"name":"Manke T."}],"journal":"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)"}}],"credit":[{"name":"Fidel Ramírez","email":"fidel.ramirez@boehringer-ingelheim.com","url":null,"orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":[],"note":null}],"community":null,"owner":"ldelisle","additionDate":"2021-01-18T10:30:24Z","lastUpdate":"2022-10-04T10:40:14.466308Z","editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"validated":0,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":"tool"}
