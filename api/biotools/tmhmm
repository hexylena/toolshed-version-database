We present a detailed analysis of TMHMM's performance, and show that it correctly predicts 97-98% of the transmembrane helices. Additionally, TMHMM can discriminate between soluble and membrane proteins with both specificity and sensitivity better than 99%, although the accuracy drops when signal peptides are present. This high degree of accuracy allowed us to predict reliably integral membrane proteins in a large collection of genomes. Based on these predictions, we estimate that 20-30% of all genes in most genomes encode membrane proteins, which is in agreement with previous estimates. We further discovered that proteins with Nin-Cin topologies are strongly preferred in all examined organisms, except Caenorhabditis elegans, where the large number of 7TM receptors increases the counts for Nout-Cin topologies. We discuss the possible relevance of this finding for our understanding of membrane protein assembly mechanisms.
