{"name":"PlantSeg","description":"Accurate and Versatile 3D Segmentation of Plant Tissues at Cellular Resolution.\n\nPlantSeg is a tool for cell instance aware segmentation in densely packed 3D volumetric images. The pipeline uses a two stages segmentation strategy (Neural Network + Segmentation). The pipeline is tuned for plant cell tissue acquired with confocal and light sheet microscopy. Pre-trained models are provided.","homepage":"https://github.com/hci-unihd/plant-seg","biotoolsID":"plantseg","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:plantseg","version":[],"otherID":[],"relation":[],"function":[{"operation":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3927","term":"Network analysis"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3799","term":"Quantification"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3552","term":"Microscope image visualisation"}],"input":[],"output":[],"note":null,"cmd":null}],"toolType":[],"topic":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0780","term":"Plant biology"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3383","term":"Bioimaging"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3385","term":"Light microscopy"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3474","term":"Machine learning"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0611","term":"Electron microscopy"}],"operatingSystem":[],"language":["Python"],"license":"MIT","collectionID":[],"maturity":null,"cost":null,"accessibility":null,"elixirPlatform":[],"elixirNode":[],"elixirCommunity":[],"link":[],"download":[],"documentation":[],"publication":[{"doi":"10.1101/2020.01.17.910562","pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"type":[],"version":null,"note":null,"metadata":null}],"credit":[{"name":"Anna Kreshuk","email":"anna.kreshuk@embl.de","url":null,"orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":[],"note":null}],"community":null,"owner":"zsmag19","additionDate":"2021-01-18T07:05:38Z","lastUpdate":"2021-01-24T07:39:36Z","editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"validated":1,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":"tool"}
