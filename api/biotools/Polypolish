{"name":"Polypolish","description":"Polypolish is a tool for polishing genome assemblies with short reads. Unlike other tools in this category, Polypolish uses SAM files where each read has been aligned to all possible locations (not just a single best location). This allows it to repair errors in repeat regions that other alignment-based polishers cannot fix.","homepage":"https://github.com/rrwick/Polypolish","biotoolsID":"polypolish","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:polypolish","version":[],"otherID":[],"relation":[],"function":[{"operation":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0525","term":"Genome assembly"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3198","term":"Read mapping"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0523","term":"Mapping assembly"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3195","term":"Sequencing error detection"}],"input":[{"data":{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_2044","term":"Sequence"},"format":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_1929","term":"FASTA"}]}],"output":[],"note":null,"cmd":null}],"toolType":["Command-line tool"],"topic":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0196","term":"Sequence assembly"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0157","term":"Sequence composition, complexity and repeats"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0102","term":"Mapping"}],"operatingSystem":[],"language":[],"license":null,"collectionID":[],"maturity":null,"cost":null,"accessibility":null,"elixirPlatform":[],"elixirNode":[],"elixirCommunity":[],"link":[{"url":"https://bridges.monash.edu/articles/dataset/Polypolish_paper_dataset/16727680","type":["Repository"],"note":null}],"download":[],"documentation":[{"url":"https://github.com/rrwick/Polypolish/wiki","type":["User manual"],"note":null}],"publication":[{"doi":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009802","pmid":"35073327","pmcid":"PMC8812927","type":[],"version":null,"note":null,"metadata":{"title":"Polypolish: Short-read polishing of long-read bacterial genome assemblies","abstract":"Copyright: Â© 2022 Wick, Holt.

Short-read polishing tools can use short reads to fix these errors, but most rely on short-read alignment which is unreliable in repeat regions. Errors in such regions are therefore challenging to fix and often remain after short-read polishing. Here we introduce Polypolish, a new short-read polisher which uses all-per-read alignments to repair errors in repeat sequences that other polishers cannot. Polypolish performed well in benchmarking tests using both simulated and real reads, and it almost never introduced errors during polishing. The best results were achieved by using Polypolish in combination with other short-read polishers.","date":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","citationCount":1,"authors":[{"name":"Wick R.R."},{"name":"Holt K.E."}],"journal":"PLoS Computational Biology"}}],"credit":[{"name":"Ryan R.
