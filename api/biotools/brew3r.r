{"name":"BREW3R.r","description":"This R package provide functions that are used in the BREW3R workflow. This mainly contains a function that extend a gtf as GRanges using information from another gtf (also as GRanges). The process allows to extend gene annotation without increasing the overlap between gene ids.","homepage":"https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/BREW3R.r.html","biotoolsID":"brew3r.r","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:brew3r.r","version":[],"otherID":[],"relation":[],"function":[{"operation":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0362","term":"Genome annotation"}],"input":[{"data":{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_1270","term":"Feature table"},"format":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2306","term":"GTF"}]}],"output":[{"data":{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_1270","term":"Feature table"},"format":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2306","term":"GTF"}]}],"note":"The output is an improved gene annotation of the input.","cmd":null}],"toolType":["Library"],"topic":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3308","term":"Transcriptomics"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0622","term":"Genomics"}],"operatingSystem":[],"language":["R"],"license":"GPL-3.0","collectionID":[],"maturity":null,"cost":null,"accessibility":"Open access","elixirPlatform":[],"elixirNode":[],"elixirCommunity":[],"link":[],"download":[],"documentation":[],"publication":[],"credit":[{"name":"Lucille Lopez-Delisle","email":"lucille.delisle@epfl.ch","url":null,"orcidid":"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1964-4960","gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":null,"typeRole":["Primary contact","Developer"],"note":null}],"community":null,"owner":"ldelisle","additionDate":"2024-06-26T18:52:53.649941Z","lastUpdate":"2024-06-26T19:03:06.430982Z","editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"validated":0,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":null}
