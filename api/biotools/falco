Although the associated computations are straightforward, in many settings the total computing effort required for quality control is appreciable and warrants optimization. We present falco, an emulation of the popular FastQC tool that runs on average three times faster while generating equivalent results. Compared to FastQC, falco also provides greater scalability for datasets with longer reads and more flexible visualization of HTML reports.","date":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","citationCount":6,"authors":[{"name":"de Sena Brandine G."},{"name":"Smith A.D."}],"journal":"F1000Research"}}],"credit":[],"community":null,"owner":"Pub2Tools","additionDate":"2020-01-14T09:13:46Z","lastUpdate":"2020-12-28T17:11:50Z","editPermission":{"type":"public","authors":[]},"validated":1,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":"tool"}
