Current approaches for transcript reconstruction from such data often rely on aligning reads to a reference genome, and are thus unsuitable for samples with a partial or missing reference genome. Here we present the Trinity method for de novo assembly of full-length transcripts and evaluate it on samples from fission yeast, mouse and whitefly, whose reference genome is not yet available. By efficiently constructing and analyzing sets of de Bruijn graphs, Trinity fully reconstructs a large fraction of transcripts, including alternatively spliced isoforms and transcripts from recently duplicated genes. Compared with other de novo transcriptome assemblers, Trinity recovers more full-length transcripts across a broad range of expression levels, with a sensitivity similar to methods that rely on genome alignments. Our approach provides a unified solution for transcriptome reconstruction in any sample, especially in the absence of a reference genome. Â© 2011 Nature America, Inc.

In this protocol we describe the use of the Trinity platform for de novo transcriptome assembly from RNA-seq data in non-model organisms. We also present Trinity-supported companion utilities for downstream applications, including RSEM for transcript abundance estimation, R/Bioconductor packages for identifying differentially expressed transcripts across samples and approaches to identify protein-coding genes. In the procedure, we provide a workflow for genome-independent transcriptome analysis leveraging the Trinity platform. The software, documentation and demonstrations are freely available from http://trinityrnaseq.sourceforge.net. The run time of this protocol is highly dependent on the size and complexity of data to be analyzed. The example data set analyzed in the procedure detailed herein can be processed in less than 5 h.","date":"2013-08-01T00:00:00Z","citationCount":4292,"authors":[{"name":"Haas B.J."},{"name":"Papanicolaou A."},{"name":"Yassour M."},{"name":"Grabherr M."},{"name":"Blood P.D."},{"name":"Bowden J."},{"name":"Couger M.B."},{"name":"Eccles D."},{"name":"Li B."},{"name":"Lieber M."},{"name":"Macmanes M.D."},{"name":"Ott M."},{"name":"Orvis J."},{"name":"Pochet N."},{"name":"Strozzi F."},{"name":"Weeks N."},{"name":"Westerman R."},{"name":"William T."},{"name":"Dewey C.N."},{"name":"Henschel R."},{"name":"Leduc R.D."},{"name":"Friedman N."},{"name":"Regev A."}],"journal":"Nature Protocols"}}],"credit":[{"name":"Nir Friedman","email":"nir@cs.huji.ac.il","url":null,"orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Primary contact"],"note":null},{"name":"Aviv Regev","email":"aregev@broad.mit.edu","url":null,"orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Primary contact"],"note":null}],"community":null,"owner":"seqwiki_import","additionDate":"2017-01-13T13:16:54Z","lastUpdate":"2022-06-27T13:38:52.696080Z","editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["sergitobara"]},"validated":1,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":null}
