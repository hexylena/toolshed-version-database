{"name":"Filtlong","description":"Filtlong is a tool for filtering long reads by quality. It can take a set of long reads and produce a smaller, better subset. It uses both read length (longer is better) and read identity (higher is better) when choosing which reads pass the filter.","homepage":"https://github.com/rrwick/Filtlong","biotoolsID":"filtlong","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:filtlong","version":["v0.2.0"],"otherID":[],"relation":[],"function":[{"operation":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3695","term":"Filtering"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3218","term":"Sequencing quality control"}],"input":[],"output":[],"note":null,"cmd":null}],"toolType":["Command-line tool"],"topic":[],"operatingSystem":["Mac","Linux"],"language":["C++"],"license":"GPL-3.0","collectionID":[],"maturity":null,"cost":"Free of charge","accessibility":"Open access","elixirPlatform":[],"elixirNode":[],"elixirCommunity":[],"link":[{"url":"https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repository?repository_id=afe854307be06b9f","type":["Other"],"note":null}],"download":[{"url":"https://anaconda.org/bioconda/filtlong","type":"Container file","note":null,"version":null}],"documentation":[],"publication":[],"credit":[],"community":null,"owner":"leipzig","additionDate":"2021-04-21T19:29:03Z","lastUpdate":"2023-11-02T09:37:28.711156Z","editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["paulzierep"]},"validated":0,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":"tool"}
