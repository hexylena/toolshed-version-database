Alevin's approach to UMI deduplication considers transcript-level constraints on the molecules from which UMIs may have arisen and accounts for both gene-unique reads and reads that multimap between genes. This addresses the inherent bias in existing tools which discard gene-ambiguous reads and improves the accuracy of gene abundance estimates. Alevin is considerably faster, typically eight times, than existing gene quantification approaches, while also using less memory.","date":"2019-03-27T00:00:00Z","citationCount":36,"authors":[{"name":"Srivastava A."},{"name":"Malik L."},{"name":"Smith T."},{"name":"Sudbery I."},{"name":"Patro R."}],"journal":"Genome Biology"}}],"credit":[{"name":"A.
