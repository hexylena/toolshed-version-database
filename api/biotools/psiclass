Here we present PsiCLASS, an accurate and efficient transcript assembler based on an approach that simultaneously analyzes multiple RNA-seq samples. PsiCLASS combines mixture statistical models for exonic feature selection across multiple samples with splice graph based dynamic programming algorithms and a weighted voting scheme for transcript selection. PsiCLASS achieves significantly better sensitivity-precision tradeoff, and renders precision up to 2-3 fold higher than the StringTie system and Scallop plus TACO, the two best current approaches. PsiCLASS is efficient and scalable, assembling 667 GEUVADIS samples in 9 h, and has robust accuracy with large numbers of samples.","date":"2019-12-01T00:00:00Z","citationCount":23,"authors":[{"name":"Song L."},{"name":"Sabunciyan S."},{"name":"Yang G."},{"name":"Florea L."}],"journal":"Nature Communications"}}],"credit":[],"community":null,"owner":"m.bernt","additionDate":"2024-07-27T12:17:38.970063Z","lastUpdate":"2024-07-27T12:21:39.314176Z","editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"validated":0,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":null}
