{"name":"MEME","description":"Tool for discovering motifs in a group of related DNA or protein sequences. A motif is a sequence pattern that occurs repeatedly in a group of related protein or DNA sequences. This tool represents motifs as position-dependent letter-probability matrices which describe the probability of each possible letter at each position in the pattern.","homepage":"http://meme-suite.org/tools/meme","biotoolsID":"meme","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:meme","version":[],"otherID":[],"relation":[],"function":[{"operation":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_2403","term":"Sequence analysis"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0239","term":"Sequence motif recognition"}],"input":[],"output":[],"note":null,"cmd":null}],"toolType":["Web application"],"topic":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3511","term":"Nucleic acid sites, features and motifs"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0654","term":"DNA"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3510","term":"Protein sites, features and motifs"}],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"language":["Java","Perl","Python"],"license":null,"collectionID":["MEME"],"maturity":null,"cost":null,"accessibility":null,"elixirPlatform":[],"elixirNode":[],"elixirCommunity":[],"link":[{"url":"http://www.mybiosoftware.com/meme-4-7-0-discovering-motifs-sequences.html","type":["Software catalogue"],"note":null}],"download":[],"documentation":[{"url":"http://meme-suite.org/doc/meme.html?man_type=web","type":["User manual"],"note":null}],"publication":[{"doi":null,"pmid":"26704599","pmcid":null,"type":[],"version":null,"note":null,"metadata":{"title":"MCAST: Scanning for cis-regulatory motif clusters","abstract":"Â© 2015 The Author. All rights reserved.Precise regulatory control of genes, particularly in eukaryotes, frequently requires the joint action of multiple sequence-specific transcription factors. A cis-regulatory module (CRM) is a genomic locus that is responsible for gene regulation and that contains multiple transcription factor binding sites in close proximity. Given a collection of known transcription factor binding motifs, many bioinformatics methods have been proposed over the past 15 years for identifying within a genomic sequence candidate CRMs consisting of clusters of those motifs. Results: The MCAST algorithm uses a hidden Markov model with a P-value-based scoring scheme to identify candidate CRMs. Here, we introduce a new version of MCAST that offers improved graphical output, a dynamic background model, statistical confidence estimates based on false discovery rate estimation and, most significantly, the ability to predict CRMs while taking into account epigenomic data such as DNase I sensitivity or histone modification data. We demonstrate the validity of MCAST's statistical confidence estimates and the utility of epigenomic priors in identifying CRMs.","date":"2016-04-15T00:00:00Z","citationCount":4,"authors":[{"name":"Grant C.E."},{"name":"Johnson J."},{"name":"Bailey T.L."},{"name":"Noble W.S."}],"journal":"Bioinformatics"}}],"credit":[{"name":"William Stafford Noble","email":null,"url":"http://meme-suite.org/doc/authors.html?man_type=web","orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Primary contact"],"note":null}],"community":null,"owner":"mbs_import","additionDate":"2017-08-03T18:49:14Z","lastUpdate":"2019-07-02T05:19:25Z","editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["wnoble"]},"validated":1,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":null}
