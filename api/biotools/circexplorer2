Interestingly, one gene locus can generate multiple circRNAs through alternative back-splicing and/or alternative splicing, thus expanding our understanding on the diversity and complexity of transcriptomes. Precise annotation of circRNAs with their alternative back-splicing and alternative splicing events is the basis for the functional characterization of different categories of circRNAs. Here we describe a step-by-step computational scheme to annotate circRNAs from publicly available RNA sequencing datasets with the CIRCexplorer2 pipeline.","date":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","citationCount":11,"authors":[{"name":"Dong R."},{"name":"Ma X.-K."},{"name":"Chen L.-L."},{"name":"Yang L."}],"journal":"Methods in Molecular Biology"}}],"credit":[{"name":"Xiao-Ou Zhang","email":"zhangxiaoou@picb.ac.cn","url":null,"orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Developer"],"note":null},{"name":"Li Yang","email":"liyang@picb.ac.cn","url":null,"orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Developer"],"note":null},{"name":"Xu-Kai Ma","email":"maxukai@picb.ac.cn","url":null,"orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Maintainer"],"note":null}],"community":null,"owner":"Ruta","additionDate":"2019-06-23T16:29:06Z","lastUpdate":"2020-06-16T10:55:23Z","editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"validated":1,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":null}
