The recovery, quantification and interpretation of such events in high-throughput sequencing datasets demands specialized bioinformatics approaches. Results: Here, we present Digital Unmasking of Nucleotide conversions in K-mers (DUNK), a data analysis pipeline enabling the quantification of nucleotide conversions in high-throughput sequencing datasets. We demonstrate using experimentally generated and simulated datasets that DUNK allows constant mapping rates irrespective of nucleotide-conversion rates, promotes the recovery of multimapping reads and employs Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) masking to uncouple true SNPs from nucleotide conversions to facilitate a robust and sensitive quantification of nucleotide-conversions. As a first application, we implement this strategy as SLAM-DUNK for the analysis of SLAMseq profiles, in which 4-thiouridine-labeled transcripts are detected based on T > C conversions. SLAM-DUNK provides both raw counts of nucleotide-conversion containing reads as well as a base-content and read coverage normalized approach for estimating the fractions of labeled transcripts as readout. Conclusion: Beyond providing a readily accessible tool for analyzing SLAMseq and related time-resolved RNA sequencing methods (TimeLapse-seq, TUC-seq), DUNK establishes a broadly applicable strategy for quantifying nucleotide conversions.","date":"2019-05-20T00:00:00Z","citationCount":20,"authors":[{"name":"Neumann T."},{"name":"Herzog V.A."},{"name":"Muhar M."},{"name":"Von Haeseler A."},{"name":"Zuber J."},{"name":"Ameres S.L."},{"name":"Rescheneder P."}],"journal":"BMC Bioinformatics"}}],"credit":[{"name":"Tobias Neumann","email":"tobias.neumann@imp.ac.at","url":null,"orcidid":"https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3908-4224","gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Primary contact"],"note":null},{"name":"Philipp Rescheneder","email":"philipp.rescheneder@gmail.com","url":null,"orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Primary contact"],"note":null}],"community":null,"owner":"hans","additionDate":"2019-08-09T13:19:26Z","lastUpdate":"2020-06-16T10:55:26Z","editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"validated":1,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":null}
