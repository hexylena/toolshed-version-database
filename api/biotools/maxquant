KGaA, Weinheim.Modern software platforms enable the analysis of shotgun proteomics data in an automated fashion resulting in high quality identification and quantification results. Additional understanding of the underlying data can be gained with the help of advanced visualization tools that allow for easy navigation through large LC-MS/MS datasets potentially consisting of terabytes of raw data. The updated MaxQuant version has a map navigation component that steers the users through mass and retention time-dependent mass spectrometric signals. It can be used to monitor a peptide feature used in label-free quantification over many LC-MS runs and visualize it with advanced 3D graphic models. An expert annotation system aids the interpretation of the MS/MS spectra used for the identification of these peptide features.","date":"2015-04-01T00:00:00Z","citationCount":117,"authors":[{"name":"Tyanova S."},{"name":"Temu T."},{"name":"Carlson A."},{"name":"Sinitcyn P."},{"name":"Mann M."},{"name":"Cox J."}],"journal":"Proteomics"}},{"doi":"10.1007/978-1-4939-1142-4_24","pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"type":[],"version":null,"note":null,"metadata":{"title":"MaxQuant for in-depth analysis of large SILAC datasets","abstract":"Proteomics experiments can generate very large volumes of data, in particular in situations where within one experimental design many samples are compared to each other, possibly in combination with pre-fractionation of samples prior to LC-MS analysis.

Here we describe MaxQuant, an integrated suite of algorithms specifically developed for high-resolution, quantitative MS data. Using correlation analysis and graph theory, MaxQuant detects peaks, isotope clusters and stable amino acid isotope-labeled (SILAC) peptide pairs as three-dimensional objects in m/z, elution time and signal intensity space. By integrating multiple mass measurements and correcting for linear and nonlinear mass offsets, we achieve mass accuracy in the p.p.b. range, a sixfold increase over standard techniques. We increase the proportion of identified fragmentation spectra to 73% for SILAC peptide pairs via unambiguous assignment of isotope and missed-cleavage state and individual mass precision. MaxQuant automatically quantifies several hundred thousand peptides per SILAC-proteome experiment and allows statistically robust identification and quantification of >4,000 proteins in mammalian cell lysates. © 2008 Nature Publishing Group.","date":"2008-12-01T00:00:00Z","citationCount":7166,"authors":[{"name":"Cox J."},{"name":"Mann M."}],"journal":"Nature Biotechnology"}},{"doi":"10.1021/ACS.JPROTEOME.0C00892","pmid":"33539096","pmcid":null,"type":[],"version":null,"note":null,"metadata":{"title":"MaxQuant.Live Enables Enhanced Selectivity and Identification of Peptides Modified by Endogenous SUMO and Ubiquitin","abstract":"© 2021 The Authors. Published by American Chemical Society.Small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMO) and ubiquitin are frequent post-translational modifications of proteins that play pivotal roles in all cellular processes. We previously reported mass spectrometry-based proteomics methods that enable profiling of lysines modified by endogenous SUMO or ubiquitin in an unbiased manner, without the need for genetic engineering. Here we investigated the applicability of precursor mass filtering enabled by MaxQuant.Live to our SUMO and ubiquitin proteomics workflows, which efficiently avoided sequencing of precursors too small to be modified but otherwise indistinguishable by mass-to-charge ratio. Using precursor mass filtering, we achieved a much higher selectivity of modified peptides, ultimately resulting in up to 30% more SUMO and ubiquitin sites identified from replicate samples. Real-time exclusion of unmodified peptides by MQL resulted in 90% SUMO-modified precursor selectivity from a 25% pure sample, demonstrating great applicability for digging deeper into ubiquitin-like modificomes. We adapted the precursor mass filtering strategy to the new Exploris 480 mass spectrometer, achieving comparable gains in SUMO precursor selectivity and identification rates. Collectively, precursor mass filtering via MQL significantly increased identification rates of SUMO- and ubiquitin-modified peptides from the exact same samples, without the requirement for prior knowledge or spectral libraries.","date":"2021-04-02T00:00:00Z","citationCount":0,"authors":[{"name":"Hendriks I.A."},{"name":"Akimov V."},{"name":"Blagoev B."},{"name":"Nielsen M.L."}],"journal":"Journal of Proteome Research"}}],"credit":[{"name":null,"email":null,"url":"http://www.coxdocs.org/doku.php?id=maxquant:common:contact","orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Primary contact"],"note":null}],"community":null,"owner":"ebi_training_import","additionDate":"2017-01-17T15:07:55Z","lastUpdate":"2021-05-28T07:12:10Z","editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["proteomics.bio.tools"]},"validated":1,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":null}
