We benchmark GraphProt, demonstrating that the modeled binding preferences conform to the literature, and showcase the biological relevance and two applications of GraphProt models. First, estimated binding affinities correlate with experimental measurements. Second, predicted Ago2 targets display higher levels of expression upon Ago2 knockdown, whereas control targets do not. Computational binding models, such as those provided by GraphProt, are essential for predicting RBP binding sites and affinities in all tissues.","date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00Z","citationCount":123,"authors":[{"name":"Maticzka D."},{"name":"Lange S.J."},{"name":"Costa F."},{"name":"Backofen R."}],"journal":"Genome Biology"}}],"credit":[{"name":null,"email":null,"url":"http://www.bioinf.uni-freiburg.de//?en","orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Primary contact"],"note":null}],"community":null,"owner":"mbs_import","additionDate":"2017-12-18T00:07:20Z","lastUpdate":"2019-01-10T04:52:51Z","editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"validated":1,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":null}
