Firstly, individual weights are assigned to each sequence in a partial alignment in order to downweight near-duplicate sequences and up-weight the most divergent ones. Secondly, amino acid substitution matrices are varied at different alignment stages according to the divergence of the sequences to be aligned. Thirdly, residue-specific gap penalties and locally reduced gap penalties in hydrophilic regions encourage new gaps in potential loop regions rather than regular secondary structure. Fourthly, positions in early alignments where gaps have been opened receive locally reduced gap penalties to encourage the opening up of new gaps at these positions. These modifications are incorporated into a new program, CLUSTAL W which is freely available. © 1994 Oxford University Press.","date":"1994-11-11T00:00:00Z","citationCount":53263,"authors":[{"name":"Thompson J.D."},{"name":"Higgins D.G."},{"name":"Gibson T.J."}],"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research"}},{"doi":"10.1093/nar/25.24.4876","pmid":null,"pmcid":"PMC147148","type":["Primary"],"version":"historical CLUSTAL X","note":"Historical publication on CLUSTAL X.

The new system is easy to use, providing an integrated system for performing multiple sequence and profile alignments and analysing the results. CLUSTAL X displays the sequence alignment in a window on the screen. A versatile sequence colouring scheme allows the user to highlight conserved features in the alignment. Pull-down menus provide all the options required for traditional multiple sequence and profile alignment. New features include: the ability to cut-and-paste sequences to change the order of the alignment, selection of a subset of the sequences to be realigned, and selection of a sub-range of the alignment to be realigned and inserted back into the original alignment. Alignment quality analysis can be performed and low-scoring segments or exceptional residues can be highlighted. Quality analysis and realignment of selected residue ranges provide the user with a powerful tool to improve and refine difficult alignments and to trap errors in input sequences. CLUSTAL X has been compiled on SUN Solaris, IRIX5.3 on Silicon Graphics, Digital UNIX on DECstations, Microsoft Windows (32 bit) for PCs, Linux ELF for x86 PCs, and Macintosh PowerMac.","date":"1997-12-15T00:00:00Z","citationCount":34280,"authors":[{"name":"Thompson J.D."},{"name":"Gibson T.J."},{"name":"Plewniak F."},{"name":"Jeanmougin F."},{"name":"Higgins D.G."}],"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research"}},{"doi":"10.1093/nar/gkg500","pmid":null,"pmcid":"PMC168907","type":["Primary"],"version":"1.83","note":"Short overview article, with some new features of Clustal, Clustal X, and other associated software nad services.

The popularity of the programs depends on a number of factors, including not only the accuracy of the results, but also the robustness, portability and user-friendliness of the programs. New features include NEXUS and FASTA format output, printing range numbers and faster tree calculation.

The method is based on first deriving a phylogenetic tree from a matrix of all pairwise sequence similarity scores, obtained using a fast pairwise alignment algorithm. Then the multiple alignment is achieved from a series of pairwise alignments of clusters of sequences, following the order of branching in the tree. The method is sufficiently fast and economical with memory to be easily implemented on a microcomputer, and yet the results obtained are comparable to those from packages requiring mainframe computer facilities. © 1988.","date":"1988-12-15T00:00:00Z","citationCount":2803,"authors":[{"name":"Higgins D.G."},{"name":"Sharp P.M."}],"journal":"Gene"}}],"credit":[{"name":"Clustal helpdesk","email":"clustalw@ucd.ie","url":null,"orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Division","typeRole":["Primary contact"],"note":null}],"community":null,"owner":"ELIXIR-EE","additionDate":"2017-03-24T09:34:04Z","lastUpdate":"2020-02-09T15:03:42Z","editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"validated":1,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":null}
