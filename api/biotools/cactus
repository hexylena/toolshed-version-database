For example, the number of vertebrate genome assemblies currently in the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) database4 increased by more than 50% to 1,485 assemblies in the year from July 2018 to July 2019. In addition to this influx of assemblies from different species, new human de novo assemblies5 are being produced, which enable the analysis of not only small polymorphisms, but also complex, large-scale structural differences between human individuals and haplotypes. This coming era and its unprecedented amount of data offer the opportunity to uncover many insights into genome evolution but also present challenges in how to adapt current analysis methods to meet the increased scale. Cactus6, a reference-free multiple genome alignment program, has been shown to be highly accurate, but the existing implementation scales poorly with increasing numbers of genomes, and struggles in regions of highly duplicated sequences. Here we describe progressive extensions to Cactus to create Progressive Cactus, which enables the reference-free alignment of tens to thousands of large vertebrate genomes while maintaining high alignment quality. We describe results from an alignment of more than 600 amniote genomes, which is to our knowledge the largest multiple vertebrate genome alignment created so far.","date":"2020-11-12T00:00:00Z","citationCount":9,"authors":[{"name":"Armstrong J."},{"name":"Hickey G."},{"name":"Diekhans M."},{"name":"Fiddes I.T."},{"name":"Novak A.M."},{"name":"Deran A."},{"name":"Fang Q."},{"name":"Xie D."},{"name":"Feng S."},{"name":"Stiller J."},{"name":"Genereux D."},{"name":"Johnson J."},{"name":"Marinescu V.D."},{"name":"Alfoldi J."},{"name":"Harris R.S."},{"name":"Lindblad-Toh K."},{"name":"Haussler D."},{"name":"Karlsson E."},{"name":"Jarvis E.D."},{"name":"Zhang G."},{"name":"Paten B."}],"journal":"Nature"}},{"doi":"10.1101/gr.123356.111","pmid":"21665927","pmcid":"PMC3166836","type":["Method"],"version":null,"note":null,"metadata":{"title":"Cactus: Algorithms for genome multiple sequence alignment","abstract":"Much attention has been given to the problem of creating reliable multiple sequence alignments in a model incorporating substitutions, insertions, and deletions. Far less attention has been paid to the problem of optimizing alignments in the presence of more general rearrangement and copy number variation. Using Cactus graphs, recently introduced for representing sequence alignments, we describe two complementary algorithms for creating genomic alignments. We have implemented these algorithms in the new \"Cactus\" alignment program. We test Cactus using the Evolver genome evolution simulator, a comprehensive new tool for simulation, and show using these and existing simulations that Cactus significantly outperforms all of its peers. Finally, we make an empirical assessment of Cactus's ability to properly align genes and find interesting cases of intra-gene duplication within the primates. © 2011 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.","date":"2011-09-01T00:00:00Z","citationCount":122,"authors":[{"name":"Paten B."},{"name":"Earl D."},{"name":"Nguyen N."},{"name":"Diekhans M."},{"name":"Zerbino D."},{"name":"Haussler D."}],"journal":"Genome Research"}},{"doi":"10.1089/cmb.2010.0252","pmid":"21385048","pmcid":null,"type":["Method"],"version":null,"note":null,"metadata":{"title":"Cactus graphs for genome comparisons","abstract":"We introduce a data structure, analysis, and visualization scheme called a cactus graph for comparing sets of related genomes.
