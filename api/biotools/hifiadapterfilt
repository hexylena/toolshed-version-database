Though adapter contamination filtering is routine in traditional short-read analysis pipelines, it has not been widely adopted for HiFi workflows. Results: Analysis of 55 publicly available HiFi datasets revealed that a read-sanitation step to remove sequence artifacts derived from PacBio library preparation from read pools is necessary as adapter sequences can be erroneously integrated into assemblies. Conclusions: Here we describe the nature of adapter contaminated reads, their consequences in assembly, and present HiFiAdapterFilt, a simple and memory efficient solution for removing adapter contaminated reads prior to assembly.","date":"2022-12-01T00:00:00Z","citationCount":6,"authors":[{"name":"Sim S.B."},{"name":"Corpuz R.L."},{"name":"Simmonds T.J."},{"name":"Geib S.M."}],"journal":"BMC Genomics"}}],"credit":[{"name":"Sheina B.
