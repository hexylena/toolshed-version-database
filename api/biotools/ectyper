Public health and food safety laboratories are increasingly adopting whole-genome sequencing (WGS) for characterizing pathogens, but it is imperative to maintain serotype designations in order to minimize disruptions to existing public health workflows. Multiple in silico tools have been developed for predicting serotypes from WGS data, including SRST2, SerotypeFinder and EToKi EBEis, but these tools were not designed with the specific requirements of diagnostic laboratories, which include: speciation, input data flexibility (fasta/fastq), quality control information and easily interpretable results. To address these specific requirements, we developed ECTyper (https://​github.​com/​phac-​nml/​ ecoli_​serotyping) for performing both speciation within Escherichia and Shigella, and in silico serotype prediction. We compared the serotype prediction performance of each tool on a newly sequenced panel of 185 isolates with confirmed phenotypic sero-type information. We found that all tools were highly concordant, with 92–97 % for O-antigens and 98–100 % for H-antigens, and ECTyper having the highest rate of concordance. We extended the benchmarking to a large panel of 6954 publicly available E. coli genomes to assess the performance of the tools on a more diverse dataset. On the public data, there was a considerable drop in concordance, with 75–91 % for O-antigens and 62–90 % for H-antigens, and ECTyper and SerotypeFinder being the most concordant. This study highlights that in silico predictions show high concordance with phenotypic serotyping results, but there are notable differences in tool performance. ECTyper provides highly accurate and sensitive in silico serotype predictions, in addition to speciation, and is designed to be easily incorporated into bioinformatic workflows.","date":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","citationCount":1,"authors":[{"name":"Bessonov K."},{"name":"Laing C."},{"name":"Robertson J."},{"name":"Yong I."},{"name":"Ziebell K."},{"name":"Gannon V.P.J."},{"name":"Nichani A."},{"name":"Arya G."},{"name":"Nash J.H.E."},{"name":"Christianson S."}],"journal":"Microbial Genomics"}}],"credit":[{"name":"Kyrylo Bessonov","email":"kyrylo.bessonov@canada.ca","url":null,"orcidid":"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9579-3183","gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":[],"note":null},{"name":"Chad Laing","email":null,"url":null,"orcidid":"https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1162-257X","gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":null,"typeRole":[],"note":null},{"name":"James Robertson","email":null,"url":null,"orcidid":"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8534-5694","gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":null,"typeRole":[],"note":null}],"community":null,"owner":"Jennifer","additionDate":"2022-06-07T21:41:41.849912Z","lastUpdate":"2022-06-07T21:41:41.852426Z","editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"validated":1,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":"tool"}
