{"name":"biomformat","description":"This package includes basic tools for reading biom-format files, accessing and subsetting data tables from a biom object, as well as limited support for writing a biom-object back to a biom-format file. The design of this API is intended to match the python API and other tools included with the biom-format project, but with a decidedly \"R flavor\" that should be familiar to R users. This includes S4 classes and methods, as well as extensions of common core functions/methods.","homepage":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/biomformat.html","biotoolsID":"biomformat","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:biomformat","version":["1.2.0"],"otherID":[],"relation":[],"function":[{"operation":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0335","term":"Formatting"}],"input":[],"output":[],"note":null,"cmd":null}],"toolType":["Command-line tool","Library"],"topic":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0607","term":"Laboratory information management"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0080","term":"Sequence analysis"}],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Windows","Mac"],"language":["R"],"license":"GPL-2.0","collectionID":["BioConductor"],"maturity":null,"cost":null,"accessibility":null,"elixirPlatform":[],"elixirNode":[],"elixirCommunity":[],"link":[{"url":"https://github.com/joey711/biomformat/","type":["Mirror"],"note":null},{"url":"http://biom-format.org/","type":["Mirror"],"note":null}],"download":[{"url":"http://bioconductor/packages/release/bioc/src/contrib/biomformat_1.2.0.tar.gz","type":"Source code","note":null,"version":null}],"documentation":[{"url":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/biomformat.html","type":["User manual"],"note":null}],"publication":[{"doi":"10.1038/nmeth.3252","pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"type":["Other"],"version":null,"note":null,"metadata":{"title":"Orchestrating high-throughput genomic analysis with Bioconductor","abstract":"Bioconductor is an open-source, open-development software project for the analysis and comprehension of high-throughput data in genomics and molecular biology. The project aims to enable interdisciplinary research, collaboration and rapid development of scientific software. Based on the statistical programming language R, Bioconductor comprises 934 interoperable packages contributed by a large, diverse community of scientists. Packages cover a range of bioinformatic and statistical applications. They undergo formal initial review and continuous automated testing.
