{"name":"fairy","description":"fast approximate contig coverage for metagenomic binning\n\nFairy computes multi-sample contig coverage for metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) binning.\n\nFairy is used after metagenomic assembly and before binning. It can\n\n- Calculate coverage 100x-1000x faster than read alignment (e.g. BWA)\n- Give comparable bins for multi-sample binning (short read or nanopore reads)\n- Output formats that are compatible with MetaBAT2, MaxBin2, SemiBin2, and more","homepage":"https://github.com/bluenote-1577/fairy","biotoolsID":"fairy","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:fairy","version":[],"otherID":[],"relation":[],"function":[{"operation":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3798","term":"Read binning"}],"input":[],"output":[],"note":null,"cmd":null},{"operation":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3180","term":"Sequence assembly validation"}],"input":[],"output":[],"note":null,"cmd":null}],"toolType":[],"topic":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3174","term":"Metagenomics"}],"operatingSystem":[],"language":[],"license":null,"collectionID":[],"maturity":null,"cost":null,"accessibility":null,"elixirPlatform":[],"elixirNode":[],"elixirCommunity":[],"link":[],"download":[],"documentation":[],"publication":[],"credit":[],"owner":"bebatut","additionDate":"2025-02-10T14:23:45.565712Z","lastUpdate":"2025-02-10T14:23:45.567998Z","editPermission":{"type":"public","authors":[]},"validated":0,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":null}
