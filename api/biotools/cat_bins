{"name":"CAT and BAT","description":"Contig Annotation Tool (CAT) and Bin Annotation Tool (BAT) are pipelines for the taxonomic classification of long DNA sequences and metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs/bins) of both known and (highly) unknown microorganisms, as generated by contemporary metagenomics studies. The core algorithm of both programs involves gene calling, mapping of predicted ORFs against the nr protein database, and voting-based classification of the entire contig / MAG based on classification of the individual ORFs.","homepage":"https://github.com/dutilh/CAT","biotoolsID":"cat_bins","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:cat_bins","version":[],"otherID":[],"relation":[],"function":[{"operation":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3460","term":"Taxonomic classification"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0310","term":"Sequence assembly"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0436","term":"Coding region prediction"}],"input":[],"output":[],"note":null,"cmd":null}],"toolType":["Library"],"topic":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3174","term":"Metagenomics"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3837","term":"Metagenomic sequencing"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0637","term":"Taxonomy"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0196","term":"Sequence assembly"}],"operatingSystem":[],"language":["Python"],"license":"MIT","collectionID":[],"maturity":null,"cost":null,"accessibility":null,"elixirPlatform":[],"elixirNode":[],"elixirCommunity":[],"link":[{"url":"https://github.com/dutilh/CAT/issues","type":["Repository"],"note":null}],"download":[],"documentation":[{"url":"https://github.com/dutilh/CAT","type":["General"],"note":null}],"publication":[{"doi":"10.1186/s13059-019-1817-x","pmid":"31640809","pmcid":"PMC6805573","type":["Primary"],"version":null,"note":null,"metadata":{"title":"Robust taxonomic classification of uncharted microbial sequences and bins with CAT and BAT","abstract":"Â© 2019 The Author(s).Current-day metagenomics analyses increasingly involve de novo taxonomic classification of long DNA sequences and metagenome-assembled genomes. Here, we show that the conventional best-hit approach often leads to classifications that are too specific, especially when the sequences represent novel deep lineages. We present a classification method that integrates multiple signals to classify sequences (Contig Annotation Tool, CAT) and metagenome-assembled genomes (Bin Annotation Tool, BAT). Classifications are automatically made at low taxonomic ranks if closely related organisms are present in the reference database and at higher ranks otherwise. The result is a high classification precision even for sequences from considerably unknown organisms.","date":"2019-10-22T00:00:00Z","citationCount":31,"authors":[{"name":"Von Meijenfeldt F.A.B."},{"name":"Arkhipova K."},{"name":"Cambuy D.D."},{"name":"Coutinho F.H."},{"name":"Dutilh B.E."}],"journal":"Genome Biology"}}],"credit":[{"name":"Bas E.
