TopHat-Fusion is an enhanced version of TopHat, an efficient program that aligns RNA-seq reads without relying on existing annotation. Because it is independent of gene annotation, TopHat-Fusion can discover fusion products deriving from known genes, unknown genes and unannotated splice variants of known genes. Using RNA-seq data from breast and prostate cancer cell lines, we detected both previously reported and novel fusions with solid supporting evidence.
