{"name":"eXpress","description":"Streaming tool for quantifying the abundances of a set of target sequences from sampled subsequences. Example applications include transcript-level RNA-Seq quantification, allele-specific/haplotype expression analysis (from RNA-Seq), transcription factor binding quantification in ChIP-Seq, and analysis of metagenomic data. It can be used to resolve ambiguous mappings in other high-throughput sequencing based applications.","homepage":"https://pachterlab.github.io/eXpress/index.html","biotoolsID":"express","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:express","version":["1.5.1"],"otherID":[],"relation":[],"function":[{"operation":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3557","term":"Imputation"}],"input":[{"data":{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_1234","term":"Sequence set (nucleic acid)"},"format":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_1929","term":"FASTA"}]},{"data":{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_1383","term":"Sequence alignment (nucleic acid)"},"format":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2572","term":"BAM"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2573","term":"SAM"}]}],"output":[{"data":{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_2048","term":"Report"},"format":[]},{"data":{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_0006","term":"Data"},"format":[]},{"data":{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_2048","term":"Report"},"format":[]}],"note":"Quantifies the abundances of a set of target sequences from sampled subsequences.

This non-uniformity must be accounted for when estimating expression levels, and we show how to perform the needed corrections using a likelihood based approach. We find improvements in expression estimates as measured by correlation with independently performed qRT-PCR and show that correction of bias leads to improved replicability of results across libraries and sequencing technologies.
