{"name":"Kraken","description":"System for assigning taxonomic labels to short DNA sequences, usually obtained through metagenomic studies. Previous attempts by other bioinformatics software to accomplish this task have often used sequence alignment or machine learning techniques that were quite slow, leading to the development of less sensitive but much faster abundance estimation programs. It aims to achieve high sensitivity and high speed by utilizing exact alignments of k-mers and a novel classification algorithm.","homepage":"https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/kraken/","biotoolsID":"kraken","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:kraken","version":["-0.10.5-beta"],"otherID":[],"relation":[],"function":[{"operation":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3460","term":"Taxonomic classification"}],"input":[{"data":{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_3494","term":"DNA sequence"},"format":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_2546","term":"FASTA-like"}]}],"output":[{"data":{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/data_3028","term":"Taxonomy"},"format":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/format_3475","term":"TSV"}]}],"note":"Classify short reads using NCBI bacterial, archaeal, and viral genomes in RefSeq sequence data should be in fasta format Format: code (classified,unclassified), sequence ID, taxonomy ID (if classified), seq length, space-delimited list indicating the LCA mapping of each $k$-mer in the sequence (taxonomyID:kmer count).\n\nEx:\n\nU       SRR443846.6494977       0       202     0:172\n\nC       r752098.1       286     100     136845:1 286:3 0:32 1415630:1 0:33\n\nU       SRR443846.9310139       0       202     0:172","cmd":null}],"toolType":["Command-line tool"],"topic":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0637","term":"Taxonomy"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3174","term":"Metagenomics"}],"operatingSystem":["Linux"],"language":["C++","Perl"],"license":"GFDL-1.3","collectionID":[],"maturity":null,"cost":null,"accessibility":null,"elixirPlatform":[],"elixirNode":[],"elixirCommunity":[],"link":[{"url":"http://github.com/DerrickWood/kraken","type":["Repository"],"note":null}],"download":[{"url":"https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/kraken/dl/kraken-0.10.5-beta.tgz","type":"Source code","note":null,"version":null},{"url":"https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/kraken/","type":"Binaries","note":null,"version":null}],"documentation":[{"url":"https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/kraken/MANUAL.html","type":["General"],"note":null}],"publication":[{"doi":"10.1186/gb-2014-15-3-r46","pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"type":["Primary"],"version":null,"note":null,"metadata":{"title":"Kraken: Ultrafast metagenomic sequence classification using exact alignments","abstract":"Kraken is an ultrafast and highly accurate program for assigning taxonomic labels to metagenomic DNA sequences. Previous programs designed for this task have been relatively slow and computationally expensive, forcing researchers to use faster abundance estimation programs, which only classify small subsets of metagenomic data. Using exact alignment of k-mers, Kraken achieves classification accuracy comparable to the fastest BLAST program. In its fastest mode, Kraken classifies 100 base pair reads at a rate of over 4.1 million reads per minute, 909 times faster than Megablast and 11 times faster than the abundance estimation program MetaPhlAn.
