Published by Oxford University Press.Motivation: Building the histogram of occurrences of every k-symbol long substring of nucleotide data is a standard step in many bioinformatics applications, known under the name of k-mer counting. Its applications include developing de Bruijn graph genome assemblers, fast multiple sequence alignment and repeat detection. The tremendous amounts of NGS data require fast algorithms for k-mer counting, preferably using moderate amounts of memory. Results: We present a novel method for k-mer counting, on large datasets about twice faster than the strongest competitors (Jellyfish 2, KMC 1), using about 12∈GB (or less) of RAM. Our disk-based method bears some resemblance to MSPKmerCounter, yet replacing the original minimizers with signatures (a carefully selected subset of all minimizers) and using (k, x)-mers allows to significantly reduce the I/O and a highly parallel overall architecture allows to achieve unprecedented processing speeds. For example, KMC 2 counts the 28-mers of a human reads collection with 44-fold coverage (106∈GB of compressed size) in about 20∈min, on a 6-core Intel i7 PC with an solid-state disk.","date":"2015-05-15T00:00:00Z","citationCount":129,"authors":[{"name":"Deorowicz S."},{"name":"Kokot M."},{"name":"Grabowski S."},{"name":"Debudaj-Grabysz A."}],"journal":"Bioinformatics"}}],"credit":[{"name":null,"email":"sebastian.deorowicz@polsl.pl","url":"http://sun.aei.polsl.pl/REFRESH/index.php?page=home","orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Primary contact"],"note":null}],"community":null,"owner":"mbs_import","additionDate":"2017-08-03T18:47:38Z","lastUpdate":"2018-12-10T12:58:56Z","editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"validated":1,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":null}
