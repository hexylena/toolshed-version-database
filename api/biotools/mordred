Various molecular-descriptor-calculation software programs have been developed. However, users of those programs must contend with several issues, including software bugs, insufficient update frequencies, and software licensing constraints. To address these issues, we propose Mordred, a developed descriptor-calculation software application that can calculate more than 1800 two- and three-dimensional descriptors. It is freely available via GitHub. Mordred can be easily installed and used in the command line interface, as a web application, or as a high-flexibility Python package on all major platforms (Windows, Linux, and macOS). Performance benchmark results show that Mordred is at least twice as fast as the well-known PaDEL-Descriptor and it can calculate descriptors for large molecules, which cannot be accomplished by other software. Owing to its good performance, convenience, number of descriptors, and a lax licensing constraint, Mordred is a promising choice of molecular descriptor calculation software that can be utilized for cheminformatics studies, such as those on quantitative structure-property relationships.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]","date":"2018-02-06T00:00:00Z","citationCount":154,"authors":[{"name":"Moriwaki H."},{"name":"Tian Y.-S."},{"name":"Kawashita N."},{"name":"Takagi T."}],"journal":"Journal of Cheminformatics"}}],"credit":[{"name":"Moriwaki H","email":"hirotomo.moriwaki@gmail.com","url":null,"orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Primary contact"],"note":null}],"community":null,"owner":"d.gabrielaitis","additionDate":"2018-07-28T13:15:00Z","lastUpdate":"2018-12-10T12:59:00Z","editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"validated":1,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":null}
