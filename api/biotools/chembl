In response, the services and infrastructure of the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI, www.ebi.ac.UK) are continually expanding: total disk capacity increases significantly every year to keep pace with demand (75 petabytes as of December 2015), and interoperability between resources remains a strategic priority. Since 2014 we have launched two new resources: the European Variation Archive for genetic variation data and EMPIAR for two-dimensional electron microscopy data, as well as a Resource Description Framework platform. We also launched the Embassy Cloud service, which allows users to run large analyses in a virtual environment next to EMBL-EBI's vast public data resources.","date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","citationCount":78,"authors":[{"name":"Cook C.E."},{"name":"Bergman M.T."},{"name":"Finn R.D."},{"name":"Cochrane G."},{"name":"Birney E."},{"name":"Apweiler R."}],"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research"}}],"credit":[{"name":"Identifiers.org","email":null,"url":null,"orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Institute","typeRole":["Provider"],"note":null},{"name":"ChEMBL Help","email":"chembl-help@ebi.ac.uk","url":null,"orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Primary contact"],"note":null},{"name":"John P.
