{"name":"MALDIquant","description":"MALDIquant is a complete analysis pipeline for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) and other two-dimensional mass spectrometry data. In addition to commonly used plotting and processing methods it includes distinctive features, namely baseline subtraction methods such as morphological filters (TopHat) or the statistics-sensitive non-linear iterative peak-clipping algorithm (SNIP), peak alignment using warping functions, handling of replicated measurements as well as allowing spectra with different resolutions.","homepage":"https://cran.r-project.org/package=MALDIquant","biotoolsID":"maldi_quant","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:maldi_quant","version":[],"otherID":[],"relation":[],"function":[{"operation":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3799","term":"Quantification"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0337","term":"Visualisation"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3860","term":"Spectrum calculation"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3215","term":"Peak detection"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3627","term":"Mass spectra calibration"}],"input":[],"output":[],"note":null,"cmd":null}],"toolType":["Library","Workflow"],"topic":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3520","term":"Proteomics experiment"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0121","term":"Proteomics"}],"operatingSystem":[],"language":["R"],"license":"GPL-3.0","collectionID":[],"maturity":null,"cost":"Free of charge","accessibility":"Open access","elixirPlatform":[],"elixirNode":[],"elixirCommunity":[],"link":[{"url":"https://github.com/sgibb/MALDIquant/","type":["Repository"],"note":null},{"url":"https://github.com/sgibb/MALDIquant/issues","type":["Issue tracker"],"note":null},{"url":"http://strimmerlab.org/software/maldiquant/","type":["Other"],"note":null}],"download":[],"documentation":[{"url":"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MALDIquant/MALDIquant.pdf","type":["General"],"note":null}],"publication":[{"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/bts447","pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"type":["Primary"],"version":null,"note":null,"metadata":{"title":"Maldiquant: A versatile R package for the analysis of mass spectrometry data","abstract":"MALDIquant is an R package providing a complete and modular analysis pipeline for quantitative analysis of mass spectrometry data.
