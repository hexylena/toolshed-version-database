The G-INS-1 option of MAFFT was recently reported to have higher accuracy than other methods for large data, but this method has been impractical for most large-scale analyses, due to the requirement of large computational resources. We introduce a scalable variant, G-large-INS-1, which has equivalent accuracy to G-INS-1 and is applicable to 50 000 or more sequences.","date":"2018-07-15T00:00:00Z","citationCount":330,"authors":[{"name":"Nakamura T."},{"name":"Yamada K.D."},{"name":"Tomii K."},{"name":"Katoh K."}],"journal":"Bioinformatics"}},{"doi":"10.1093/bib/bbx108","pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"type":["Other"],"version":null,"note":null,"metadata":{"title":"MAFFT online service: Multiple sequence alignment, interactive sequence choice and visualization","abstract":"© 2017 The Author. Published by Oxford University Press.This article describes several features in the MAFFT online service for multiple sequence alignment (MSA). As a result of recent advances in sequencing technologies, huge numbers of biological sequences are available and the need for MSAs with large numbers of sequences is increasing. To extract biologically relevant information from such data, sophistication of algorithms is necessary but not sufficient. Intuitive and interactive tools for experimental biologists to semiautomatically handle large data are becoming important. We are working on development of MAFFT toward these two directions. Here, we explain (i) the Web interface for recently developed options for large data and (ii) interactive usage to refine sequence data sets and MSAs.","date":"2018-03-27T00:00:00Z","citationCount":2258,"authors":[{"name":"Katoh K."},{"name":"Rozewicki J."},{"name":"Yamada K.D."}],"journal":"Briefings in Bioinformatics"}},{"doi":"10.1093/molbev/mst010","pmid":"23329690","pmcid":"PMC3603318","type":[],"version":"7","note":null,"metadata":{"title":"MAFFT multiple sequence alignment software version 7: Improvements in performance and usability","abstract":"We report a major update of the MAFFT multiple sequence alignment program.

The new version (5.3) of MAFFT offers new iterative refinement options, H-INS-i, F-INS-i and G-INS-i, in which pairwise alignment information are incorporated into objective function. These new options of MAFFT showed higher accuracy than currently available methods including TCoffee version 2 and CLUSTAL W in benchmark tests consisting of alignments of >50 sequences. Like the previously available options, the new options of MAFFT can handle hundreds of sequences on a standard desktop computer. We also examined the effect of the number of homologues included in an alignment. For a multiple alignment consisting of ∼8 sequences with low similarity, the accuracy was improved (2-10 percentage points) when the sequences were aligned together with dozens of their close homologues (E-value < 10-5-10-20) collected from a database. Such improvement was generally observed for most methods, but remarkably large for the new options of MAFFT proposed here. Thus, we made a Ruby script, mafftE.rb, which aligns the input sequences together with their close homologues collected from SwissProt using NCBI-BLAST. © Oxford University Press 2005; all rights reserved.","date":"2005-03-29T00:00:00Z","citationCount":3551,"authors":[{"name":"Katoh K."},{"name":"Kuma K.-I."},{"name":"Toh H."},{"name":"Miyata T."}],"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research"}}],"credit":[{"name":null,"email":null,"url":"https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/mailform.html","orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Project","typeRole":["Primary contact"],"note":"Contact form"}],"community":{"biolib":{"app_name":"MAFFT","author_name":"bio-utils","author_username":"bio-utils"}},"owner":"jison","additionDate":"2017-12-06T18:14:39Z","lastUpdate":"2023-10-31T13:39:11.958884Z","editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["laurasansc","sergitobara","jw"]},"validated":1,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":null}
