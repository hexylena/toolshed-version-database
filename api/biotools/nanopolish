All rights reserved.In nanopore sequencing devices, electrolytic current signals are sensitive to base modifcations, such as 5-methylcytosine (5-mc). here we quantifed the strength of this effect for the oxford nanopore technologies minion sequencer. by using synthetically methylated dna, we were able to train a hidden markov model to distinguish 5-mc from unmethylated cytosine. We applied our method to sequence the methylome of human dna, without requiring special steps for library preparation.","date":"2017-02-20T00:00:00Z","citationCount":279,"authors":[{"name":"Simpson J.T."},{"name":"Workman R.E."},{"name":"Zuzarte P.C."},{"name":"David M."},{"name":"Dursi L.J."},{"name":"Timp W."}],"journal":"Nature Methods"}}],"credit":[{"name":"Jared Simpson","email":null,"url":"https://github.com/jts","orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Primary contact"],"note":null}],"community":null,"owner":"ELIXIR-EE","additionDate":"2018-06-11T14:07:17Z","lastUpdate":"2020-06-16T10:55:20Z","editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"validated":1,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":null}
