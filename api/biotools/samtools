It is flexible in style, compact in size, efficient in random access and is the format in which alignments from the 1000 Genomes Project are released. SAM tools implements various utilities for post-processing alignments in the SAM format, such as indexing, variant caller and alignment viewer, and thus provides universal tools for processing read alignments. © 2009 The Author(s).","date":"2009-08-01T00:00:00Z","citationCount":39076,"authors":[{"name":"Li H."},{"name":"Handsaker B."},{"name":"Wysoker A."},{"name":"Fennell T."},{"name":"Ruan J."},{"name":"Homer N."},{"name":"Marth G."},{"name":"Abecasis G."},{"name":"Durbin R."}],"journal":"Bioinformatics"}},{"doi":"10.1093/gigascience/giab008","pmid":"33590861","pmcid":"PMC7931819","type":["Primary"],"version":null,"note":"Twelve years of SAMtools and BCFtools.","metadata":{"title":"Twelve years of SAMtools and BCFtools","abstract":"Background: SAMtools and BCFtools are widely used programs for processing and analysing high-throughput sequencing data. They include tools for file format conversion and manipulation, sorting, querying, statistics, variant calling, and effect analysis amongst other methods. Findings: The first version appeared online 12 years ago and has been maintained and further developed ever since, with many new features and improvements added over the years. The SAMtools and BCFtools packages represent a unique collection of tools that have been used in numerous other software projects and countless genomic pipelines. Conclusion: Both SAMtools and BCFtools are freely available on GitHub under the permissive MIT licence, free for both non-commercial and commercial use. Both packages have been installed >1 million times via Bioconda.

However, in applications of the next-generation sequencing (NGS), accurate genotypes may not be easily obtained (e.g. multi-sample low-coverage sequencing or somatic mutation discovery). These applications press for the development of new methods for analyzing sequence data with uncertainty. Results: We present a statistical framework for calling SNPs, discovering somatic mutations, inferring population genetical parameters and performing association tests directly based on sequencing data without explicit genotyping or linkage-based imputation. On real data, we demonstrate that our method achieves comparable accuracy to alternative methods for estimating site allele count, for inferring allele frequency spectrum and for association mapping. We also highlight the necessity of using symmetric datasets for finding somatic mutations and confirm that for discovering rare events, mismapping is frequently the leading source of errors. © The Author 2011.
