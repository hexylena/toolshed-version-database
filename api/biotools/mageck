We present MAGeCK-VISPR, a comprehensive quality control (QC), analysis, and visualization workflow for CRISPR screens. MAGeCK-VISPR defines a set of QC measures to assess the quality of an experiment, and includes a maximum-likelihood algorithm to call essential genes simultaneously under multiple conditions. The algorithm uses a generalized linear model to deconvolute different effects, and employs expectation-maximization to iteratively estimate sgRNA knockout efficiency and gene essentiality. MAGeCK-VISPR also includes VISPR, a framework for the interactive visualization and exploration of QC and analysis results.","date":"2015-12-16T00:00:00Z","citationCount":106,"authors":[{"name":"Li W."},{"name":"Koster J."},{"name":"Xu H."},{"name":"Chen C.-H."},{"name":"Xiao T."},{"name":"Liu J.S."},{"name":"Brown M."},{"name":"Liu X.S."}],"journal":"Genome Biology"}}],"credit":[{"name":"Dana Farber","email":null,"url":"http://liulab.dfci.harvard.edu/","orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Primary contact"],"note":null}],"community":null,"owner":"mbs_import","additionDate":"2017-08-03T18:48:45Z","lastUpdate":"2018-12-10T12:58:55Z","editPermission":{"type":"private","authors":[]},"validated":1,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":null}
