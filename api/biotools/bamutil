We present GotCloud, a pipeline for efficiently detecting and genotyping highquality variants from large-scale sequencing data. GotCloud automates sequence alignment, sample-level quality control, variant calling, filtering of likely artifacts using machine-learning techniques, and genotype refinement using haplotype information. The pipeline can process thousands of samples in parallel and requires less computational resources than current alternatives. Experiments with whole-genome and exome-targeted sequence data generated by the 1000 Genomes Project show that the pipeline provides effective filtering against false positive variants and high power to detect true variants. Our pipeline has already contributed to variant detection and genotyping in several large-scale sequencing projects, including the 1000 Genomes Project and the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project. We hope it will now prove useful to many medical sequencing studies.","date":"2015-06-01T00:00:00Z","citationCount":93,"authors":[{"name":"Jun G."},{"name":"Wing M.K."},{"name":"Abecasis G.R."},{"name":"Kang H.M."}],"journal":"Genome Research"}}],"credit":[{"name":"Mary Kate Wing","email":"mktrost@umich.edu","url":"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bamUtils","orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Primary contact"],"note":null}],"community":null,"owner":"admin","additionDate":"2017-08-20T15:07:31Z","lastUpdate":"2019-09-04T08:37:55Z","editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["animalandcropgenomics"]},"validated":1,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":null}
