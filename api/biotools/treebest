{"name":"TreeBeST","description":"TreeBeST, which stands for (gene) Tree Building guided by Species Tree, is a versatile program that builds, manipulates and displays phylogenetic trees. It is particularly designed for building gene trees with a known species tree and is highly efficient and accurate.\n\nTreeBeST is previously known as NJTREE. It has been largely used in the TreeFam database, Ensembl Compara and OPTIC database of Chris Ponting group.","homepage":"https://treesoft.sourceforge.net/treebest.shtml","biotoolsID":"treebest","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:treebest","version":["1.9.2.post0"],"otherID":[],"relation":[],"function":[{"operation":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0567","term":"Phylogenetic tree visualisation"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0324","term":"Phylogenetic analysis"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0540","term":"Phylogenetic inference (from molecular sequences)"}],"input":[],"output":[],"note":null,"cmd":null}],"toolType":[],"topic":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3293","term":"Phylogenetics"}],"operatingSystem":[],"language":[],"license":null,"collectionID":[],"maturity":null,"cost":null,"accessibility":null,"elixirPlatform":[],"elixirNode":[],"elixirCommunity":[],"link":[],"download":[],"documentation":[],"publication":[],"credit":[],"community":null,"owner":"paulzierep","additionDate":"2024-03-07T08:02:16.739017Z","lastUpdate":"2024-03-12T09:10:30.221938Z","editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["EngyNasr"]},"validated":0,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":null}
