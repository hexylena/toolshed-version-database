It provides the ability to analyse complex experiments involving multiple treatment conditions and blocking variables while still taking full account of biological variation. Biological variation between RNA samples is estimated separately from the technical variation associated with sequencing technologies. Novel empirical Bayes methods allow each gene to have its own specific variability, even when there are relatively few biological replicates from which to estimate such variability. The pipeline is implemented in the edgeR package of the Bioconductor project. A case study analysis of carcinoma data demonstrates the ability of generalized linear model methods (GLMs) to detect differential expression in a paired design, and even to detect tumour-specific expression changes. The case study demonstrates the need to allow for gene-specific variability, rather than assuming a common dispersion across genes or a fixed relationship between abundance and variability. Genewise dispersions de-prioritize genes with inconsistent results and allow the main analysis to focus on changes that are consistent between biological replicates. Parallel computational approaches are developed to make non-linear model fitting faster and more reliable, making the application of GLMs to genomic data more convenient and practical. Simulations demonstrate the ability of adjusted profile likelihood estimators to return accurate estimators of biological variability in complex situations. When variation is gene-specific, empirical Bayes estimators provide an advantageous compromise between the extremes of assuming common dispersion or separate genewise dispersion. The methods developed here can also be applied to count data arising from DNA-Seq applications, including ChIP-Seq for epigenetic marks and DNA methylation analyses. © 2011 The Author(s).","date":"2012-05-01T00:00:00Z","citationCount":2399,"authors":[{"name":"McCarthy D.J."},{"name":"Chen Y."},{"name":"Smyth G.K."}],"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research"}},{"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btp616","pmid":"19910308","pmcid":"PMC2796818","type":[],"version":null,"note":null,"metadata":{"title":"edgeR: A Bioconductor package for differential expression analysis of digital gene expression data","abstract":"It is expected that emerging digital gene expression (DGE) technologies will overtake microarray technologies in the near future for many functional genomics applications. One of the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different across experimental conditions. edgeR is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential expression of replicated count data. An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count data. © The Author(s) 2009.

One of the most common aims of RNA-seq profiling is to identify genes or molecular pathways that are differentially expressed (DE) between two or more biological conditions. This article demonstrates a computational workflow for the detection of DE genes and pathways from RNA-seq data by providing a complete analysis of an RNA-seq experiment profiling epithelial cell subsets in the mouse mammary gland. The workflow uses R software packages from the open-source Bioconductor project and covers all steps of the analysis pipeline, including alignment of read sequences, data exploration, differential expression analysis, visualization and pathway analysis. Read alignment and count quantification is conducted using the Rsubread package and the statistical analyses are performed using the edgeR package. The differential expression analysis uses the quasi-likelihood functionality of edgeR.","date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","citationCount":217,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Y."},{"name":"Lun A.T.L."},{"name":"Smyth G.K."}],"journal":"F1000Research"}}],"credit":[{"name":"Yunshun Chen","email":"yuchen@wehi.edu.au","url":null,"orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Primary contact"],"note":null},{"name":"Aaron Lun","email":"alun@wehi.edu.au","url":null,"orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Primary contact"],"note":null},{"name":"Mark Robinson","email":"mark.robinson@imls.uzh.ch","url":null,"orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Primary contact"],"note":null},{"name":"Davis McCarthy","email":"dmccarthy@wehi.edu.au","url":null,"orcidid":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2218-6833","gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Primary contact"],"note":null},{"name":"Gordon Smyth","email":"smyth@wehi.edu.au","url":null,"orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Primary contact"],"note":null}],"community":null,"owner":"bioconductor_import","additionDate":"2017-01-17T14:57:49Z","lastUpdate":"2022-06-21T07:26:32.171625Z","editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["sergitobara"]},"validated":1,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":null}
