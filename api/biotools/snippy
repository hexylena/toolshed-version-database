It will find both substitutions (snps) and insertions/deletions (indels). It will use as many CPUs as you can give it on a single computer (tested to 64 cores). It is designed with speed in mind, and produces a consistent set of output files in a single folder. It can then take a set of Snippy results using the same reference and generate a core SNP alignment (and ultimately a phylogenomic tree).","cmd":null}],"toolType":["Command-line tool"],"topic":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0622","term":"Genomics"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0621","term":"Model organisms"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_2885","term":"DNA polymorphism"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3293","term":"Phylogenetics"}],"operatingSystem":["Linux","Mac"],"language":["Python"],"license":"GPL-3.0","collectionID":[],"maturity":null,"cost":null,"accessibility":null,"elixirPlatform":[],"elixirNode":[],"elixirCommunity":[],"link":[{"url":"https://github.com/tseemann/snippy/","type":["Repository"],"note":null}],"download":[],"documentation":[{"url":"https://github.com/tseemann/snippy/blob/master/README.md","type":["General"],"note":null}],"publication":[],"credit":[{"name":"Torsten Seemann","email":null,"url":null,"orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Developer"],"note":null},{"name":"University of Melbourne, Australia","email":null,"url":null,"orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Institute","typeRole":["Provider"],"note":null},{"name":"unimelb.edu.au","email":null,"url":null,"orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Institute","typeRole":["Provider"],"note":null},{"name":"Torsten Seemann","email":"torsten.seemann@gmail.com","url":"https://github.com/tseemann/snippy/issues","orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Primary contact"],"note":null},{"name":"Australia","email":null,"url":"https://github.com/tseemann/snippy/issues","orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Primary contact"],"note":null}],"community":null,"owner":"griffinp@unimelb.edu.au","additionDate":"2016-09-02T00:53:09Z","lastUpdate":"2023-11-02T09:06:08.194721Z","editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["ELIXIR-CZ"]},"validated":1,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":null}
