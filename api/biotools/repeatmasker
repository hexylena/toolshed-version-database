{"name":"RepeatMasker","description":"A program that screens DNA sequences for interspersed repeats and low complexity DNA sequences. The output of the program is a detailed annotation of the repeats that are present in the query sequence as well as a modified version of the query sequence in which all the annotated repeats have been masked (default: replaced by Ns).","homepage":"http://www.repeatmasker.org/","biotoolsID":"repeatmasker","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:repeatmasker","version":[],"otherID":[],"relation":[],"function":[{"operation":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0362","term":"Genome annotation"}],"input":[],"output":[],"note":null,"cmd":null}],"toolType":["Command-line tool"],"topic":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0080","term":"Sequence analysis"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0157","term":"Sequence composition, complexity and repeats"}],"operatingSystem":["Linux"],"language":["Perl"],"license":"OSL-2.1","collectionID":["Animal and Crop Genomics"],"maturity":null,"cost":null,"accessibility":null,"elixirPlatform":[],"elixirNode":[],"elixirCommunity":[],"link":[],"download":[],"documentation":[{"url":"http://www.repeatmasker.org/webrepeatmaskerhelp.html","type":["General"],"note":null}],"publication":[],"credit":[{"name":null,"email":null,"url":"http://www.repeatmasker.org/RMDownload.html","orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Primary contact"],"note":null}],"community":null,"owner":"admin","additionDate":"2017-08-20T17:21:27Z","lastUpdate":"2019-09-04T08:38:28Z","editPermission":{"type":"group","authors":["animalandcropgenomics"]},"validated":1,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":null}
