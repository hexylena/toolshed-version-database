{"name":"humann","description":"HUMAnN is a pipeline for efficiently and accurately profiling the presence/absence and abundance of microbial pathways in a community from metagenomic or metatranscriptomic sequencing data (typically millions of short DNA/RNA reads). This process, referred to as functional profiling, aims to describe the metabolic potential of a microbial community and its members. More generally, functional profiling answers the question “What are the microbes in my community-of-interest doing (or are capable of doing)?”","homepage":"https://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/humann","biotoolsID":"humann","biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:humann","version":["3.0-3.6.1"],"otherID":[],"relation":[{"biotoolsID":"humann2","type":"isNewVersionOf"}],"function":[{"operation":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3221","term":"Species frequency estimation"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3460","term":"Taxonomic classification"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0324","term":"Phylogenetic analysis"}],"input":[],"output":[],"note":null,"cmd":null}],"toolType":["Command-line tool"],"topic":[{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3174","term":"Metagenomics"},{"uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0194","term":"Phylogenomics"}],"operatingSystem":[],"language":["Python"],"license":"MIT","collectionID":["biobakery"],"maturity":"Mature","cost":"Free of charge","accessibility":"Open access","elixirPlatform":[],"elixirNode":[],"elixirCommunity":[],"link":[{"url":"https://github.com/biobakery/humann","type":["Repository"],"note":null}],"download":[{"url":"https://github.com/biobakery/humann","type":"Source code","note":null,"version":null}],"documentation":[{"url":"https://github.com/biobakery/biobakery/wiki/humann3","type":["Training material"],"note":null}],"publication":[{"doi":"10.7554/eLife.65088","pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"type":["Primary"],"version":"3.0","note":null,"metadata":{"title":"Integrating taxonomic, functional, and strain-level profiling of diverse microbial communities with biobakery 3","abstract":"Culture-independent analyses of microbial communities have progressed dramatically in the last decade, particularly due to advances in methods for biological profiling via shotgun metagenomics. Opportunities for improvement continue to accelerate, with greater access to multi-omics, microbial reference genomes, and strain-level diversity. To leverage these, we present bioBakery 3, a set of integrated, improved methods for taxonomic, strain-level, functional, and phylogenetic profiling of metagenomes newly developed to build on the largest set of reference sequences now available. Compared to current alternatives, MetaPhlAn 3 increases the accuracy of taxonomic profiling, and HUMAnN 3 improves that of functional potential and activity. These methods detected novel disease-microbiome links in applications to CRC (1262 metagenomes) and IBD (1635 metagenomes and 817 metatranscriptomes). Strain-level profiling of an additional 4077 metagenomes with StrainPhlAn 3 and PanPhlAn 3 unraveled the phylogenetic and functional structure of the common gut microbe Ruminococcus bromii, previously described by only 15 isolate genomes. With open-source implementations and cloud-deployable reproducible workflows, the bioBakery 3 platform can help researchers deepen the resolution, scale, and accuracy of multi-omic profiling for microbial community studies.","date":"2021-05-01T00:00:00Z","citationCount":259,"authors":[{"name":"Beghini F."},{"name":"McIver L.J."},{"name":"Blanco-Miguez A."},{"name":"Dubois L."},{"name":"Asnicar F."},{"name":"Maharjan S."},{"name":"Mailyan A."},{"name":"Manghi P."},{"name":"Scholz M."},{"name":"Thomas A.M."},{"name":"Valles-Colomer M."},{"name":"Weingart G."},{"name":"Zhang Y."},{"name":"Zolfo M."},{"name":"Huttenhower C."},{"name":"Franzosa E.A."},{"name":"Segata N."}],"journal":"eLife"}}],"credit":[{"name":"Curtis Huttenhower","email":"chuttenh@hsph.harvard.edu","url":"https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/profile/curtis-huttenhower/","orcidid":null,"gridid":null,"rorid":null,"fundrefid":null,"typeEntity":"Person","typeRole":["Developer"],"note":null}],"community":null,"owner":"tunc","additionDate":"2023-03-29T06:55:14.040128Z","lastUpdate":"2023-03-29T06:55:14.042863Z","editPermission":{"type":"public","authors":[]},"validated":0,"homepage_status":0,"elixir_badge":0,"confidence_flag":null}
